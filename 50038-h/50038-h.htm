<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In complying with the request of the publishers
of the <i>Nations</i> Series to write the Story of Hungary,
I undertook a task which was out of the range of
my previous literary undertakings, which had for the
most part been devoted to the geography, history,
and philology of Central Asia. The principal reason
which induced me to enter upon what is for me a
new literary field, was my desire to make American
and English readers acquainted with the record of
my native country, and to present the various phases
of the history of Hungary in the light best suited to
attract the attention of the citizens of England and
of the Great Republic, to whose opinion we Hungarians
are by no means indifferent.</p>

<p>My willingness to prepare the present volume was
further due to the fact, that it was not the <i>History</i>, but
the <i>Story</i> of Hungary, I was asked to write; an undertaking
in which I had simply to deal with the salient
events, the most noteworthy personalities, and the
most thrilling episodes in a narrative which covered
nearly a thousand years, and was not called upon to
consider the philosophical side of the history, or to
discuss the deeper-lying motives or the less significant
details of national action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span></p>

<p>For a task such as that presented to me, I concluded
that the knowledge and the ideas of a Hungarian
man of letters were not inadequate; I have,
nevertheless, had recourse, in certain instances, to the
assistance of writers who had given special attention
to our national history, with the idea of making as
accurate as possible this <i>the first Story of Hungary
written in English</i>.</p>

<p>The distance between Buda-Pesth and New York
rendered it impossible for me to give my personal
attention to the proofs while the volume was being
put into type. The proof-reading was therefore entrusted
to the care of Mr. Louis Heilprin, a gentleman
who is evidently thoroughly familiar with the
subject, and to whom I desire to express my obligations
not only for the care he has taken with the
proof-reading, but also for his attention in securing
in my English text the most accurate and most
effective forms of expression.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity of expressing, also, my
thanks for the kind coöperation of my countrymen,
Messrs. Sebestyén, Csánki, Acsády, and Vargha.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />

<small>THE COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE OF HUNGARY.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexander Petöfi</span>, the great Hungarian poet,
in one of his beautiful poems, sings thus of his native
land:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“If the earth be God’s crown</div>
<div class="line">Our country is its fairest jewel.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And truly were we able to ascend the airy heights
and obtain a bird’s-eye view of Hungary, we would
fain admit that it is one of the fairest and most
blessed spots on the face of the earth.</p>

<p>In the Northwest of Hungary, on the banks of the
Danube, begins the mountainous region known under
the name of the Carpathian range, which for beauty
is not surpassed by the Alps, and in extent fairly
rivals them. This mountain range, encircling like a
gigantic evergreen wreath one half of the country,
extends all along its northern boundary and, after
enclosing the eastern portion of it, stretches westward
to where it is intersected by the waters of the
Danube, not terminating there, however, but branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>ing
off into the countries lying along the lower course
of that river.</p>

<p>The whole range of the Carpathians is characterized
throughout its immensely long course by considerable
breadth, forming at some places quite a
hilly country and high plateaus, as, for instance, in
Transylvania which, although properly belonging to
Hungary, formerly enjoyed a sort of independence
under its own name. This territory is covered almost
entirely by the Carpathians, but, of course,
designated here by different names.</p>

<p>We shall proceed now in due order.</p>

<p>In the Northwest, there where the Danube enters
Hungarian territory near Dévény, the mountain
chain begins, under the name of the Northwestern
Carpathians; these, describing the shape of a half
moon, extend from Presburg (Pozsony) to the Hernád-Tarcza
valley. Formerly three groups only
were mentioned in connection with this section:
namely, the Tátra, Fátra, and Mátra, a representation
of which, as well as of the four rivers, the Danube,
Theiss, Drave, and Save, is embodied in the
arms of the country, whence Hungary is designated
as “the country of the three mountains and four
rivers.” The Northwestern Carpathians are, however,
a gigantic mountain mass of immense bulk,
subdivided into several distinct ranges. Of these
one, the Northwestern border mountain-range, starting
near the Danube in Presburg County and extending
in the shape of a wide arch in a northeastern
direction as far as the sources of the Árva river,
divides Hungary from Moravia, Silesia, and Galicia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a><br /><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>This ridge is constantly rising, and reaches the highest
elevation at its northern edge. Another range is
the Little Kreván, which begins in Árva County, and
extends through the flatlands between the Vág and
Nyitra rivers. East of this are the Gömör mountain-range,
famous for its stalactitic caves, including Aggtelek;
the Mátra range, extending from Miskolcz
to Vácz; and the loftiest of all, the High Tátra,
whose highest peaks are those of Jégvölgy, Gerlachfalva,
and Lomnicz, rising to an altitude of between
8,000 and 9,000 feet. The mountains belonging to
this group are snow-covered, and what renders them
peculiarly interesting are the so-called <i>tengerszemek</i>
(eyes of the sea), limpid lakes of unfathomable
depth, which, according to popular belief, are connected
with the sea, and about which a good many
old-time legendary tales are current amongst the
people. These lakes are met with at the height
of 1,900 metres above the level of the sea.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="i024" id="i024">
<img src="images/i_024.png" width="400" height="515" alt="DANUBE FROM THE RUINS OF VISEGRÁD." />
<span class="caption">DANUBE FROM THE RUINS OF VISEGRÁD.</span></a></div>

<p><br />That range of mountains which extends eastwards
from the Hernád-Tarcza valley to the southeastern
angle of Mármaros County is called the Northeastern
Carpathians. It includes the Wooded Carpathians
and the Eperjes-Tokay range, in the southern part
of which, the Hegyalja, the king of the wines, the
famous Tokay wine, is produced.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="i026" id="i026">
<img src="images/i_026.png" width="400" height="466" alt="ICE-GROTTO OF DEMÉNYFALVA." />
<span class="caption">ICE-GROTTO OF DEMÉNYFALVA.</span></a></div>

<p>The southeastern chain of the Carpathians divides
where Mármaros County, Transylvania, and Bukovina
converge into an angle, forming several main
lines which enclose the territory of Transylvania
in an almost quadrangular shape and give it the
character of a high plateau. The name of this group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
is the Southeastern Carpathians. Parts of it are the
Transylvanian northern and eastern border ranges;
the Hargita range, with the remarkable Mount
Büdös, containing several caves from which issue
strong gases, and the beautiful lake of St. Anna at a
height of 950 metres; the southern border range, the
largest and most massive portion of the Carpathian
mountains; the mountain group of the Banate and
the mineral mountain range of the Banate, the latter
owing its name to the gold, silver, and other ores
as well as the coal abounding in it. This group
projects as far as the basin of the Danube and forms
there the passes known as the Iron Gate, which
greatly impede navigation. To the Transylvanian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Hungarian range, extending north from the Maros
river, belong the mineral mountains of Transylvania,
rich in gold and other ore, and the mountain called
Királyhágó, which marks the frontier between Hungary
and the independent Transylvania of old.</p>

<p>Thirty-eight passes lead from this mountain-system
of gigantic dimensions, partly into the countries adjacent
to Hungary, partly into the regions divided
by them. Of these the most important are: the
Jablunka pass, communicating with Silesia and the
valley of the Vistula; the Vereczke pass between
Munkács and Stry, supposed to be the pass through
which the Hungarians entered their present country;
the Radna pass, leading into Bukovina; the Ojtóz
pass, communicating with Moldavia; the Tömös
pass, leading to Bucharest; and the Red Tower pass,
leading into Little Wallachia.</p>

<p>Besides the Carpathian mountains Hungary also
contains a less considerable portion of the Alps, belonging
to the so-called Noric Alps. They lie in
trans-Danubian Hungary, the Pannonia of old. They
embrace the Austro-Styrian border-range, between
the valleys of the Danube and Drave; the Vértes-Bakony
ranges, of which the Bakony forest forms a
part; and the group of the Buda mountains, producing
the celebrated wines of that name.</p>

<p>Croatia and Slavonia, which are parts of the Hungarian
realm, are also traversed by mountains belonging
to the Alpine system.</p>

<p>We perceive from the preceding account that a
large portion of the country is mountainous, but
over a third part of it is level land, and so fertile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
that it may compare to the prairies in North America.
The great Hungarian plain, the so-called Alföld
(Lowland), boasts of the best soil for the production
of wheat, and, stretching down from the offshoots
of the Central Carpathians to the frontiers of Servia
contains upward of 35,000 square miles.</p>

<span class="caption">BORDERS OF THE DANUBE.</span></a></div>

<p>The extent of the water system of a country and
its distribution is always of the first importance. In
this respect, too, Hungary has been blessed by nature.
Of the sea she has but little; a small portion only of
the Adriatic washes her shores, the so-called Hungarian
Sea-Coast, where Fiume, the only important
Hungarian seaport city, is situated. The country possesses
also some interesting lakes; one, Lake Balaton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
forty-seven miles long and nine miles wide, has the
characteristics of the sea to such an extent that
it is called the Hungarian Sea. In this extensive
water is to be found the savory <i>fogas</i> fish, and on its
shores is situated Balaton-Füred, one of the favorite
watering-places of Hungary, and near this place
is the famous echo of Tihany. Another large lake
is the Fertö (Neu-Siedler), eighteen miles long and
about five miles wide, which became perfectly dry
in 1863, so that even houses were built on its bed,
but the waters have returned to it within the last
few years. Several smaller lakes, besides the two
mentioned, are scattered throughout the country.</p>

<p>With rivers the country is abundantly supplied.
Its mightiest stream is the Danube, after the Volga,
the largest river in Europe. The whole of Hungary
belongs to its basin. Its length in Hungary is 600
miles, and it leaves the country at Orsova, after having
formed several islands in its course. The largest
among these is the Great Csalló region, which
contains two towns and over a hundred villages;
and the most beautiful of them is Margit (Margaret)
Island, near Buda-Pesth—quite a miniature paradise,
frequented by a great many strangers, who come here
to get the benefit of its excellent baths. Of the numerous
affluents of the Danube the Theiss is the
most important; it has its sources in the country
and empties into the Danube on Hungarian soil,
near Titel. It is navigable for steamships. The
Save and Drave are after the Theiss the largest
tributaries of the Danube. All these rivers send
their waters, through the medium of the Danube,
into the Black Sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>Thus harmoniously is the soil of Hungary varied
by mountains, valleys, plains, and high plateaus,
and gratefully watered by rivers and lakes; and if
we but add that the country lies between the forty-fourth
and fiftieth degrees of northern latitude,
that is, in the most favorable part of the temperate
zone, we may readily infer the superiority of the climatic
conditions prevailing there. There is, of course,
great variety of climate. The winter is raw and cold
in the Carpathian regions; spring sets in later, winter
comes earlier, and the cold sometimes reaches -22° F.
In the hilly and level country the climate is much
more genial, the summers hotter, and storms of more
frequent occurrence. Wheat, grapes, and maize do
not ripen in the regions of the higher Carpathians,
whilst the Alföld produces the best and finest wheat,
and even rice. The air is most genial on the shores
of the Adriatic, and here are grown the fruits of
Southern Europe. The climate, as a general thing,
is dry, especially in the Alföld, where trees are rare.</p>

<p>Such is the topography and climate of the country
which, lying in the central portion of Middle Europe,
stretches between Moravia, Silesia, Galicia, Bukovina,
Roumania, Servia, Bosnia, the Adriatic Sea, Istria,
Carinthia, Styria, and Austria. It covers an area of
125,000 square miles, and has a population of nearly
sixteen millions.</p>

<p>Politically the country is divided into three parts,
namely: Hungary proper (including the formerly
detached Transylvania), the city and territory of
Fiume, and Croatia and Slavonia. Dalmatia, too,
ought to belong under the old laws to the country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
but, for a long time already, it has owned the supremacy
of Austria.</p>

<span class="caption">BUDA-PESTH.</span></a></div>

<p>Buda-Pesth is the capital of the entire kingdom.
Situated on both banks of the majestic Danube,
here spanned by three beautiful bridges, amongst
them the famous suspension bridge, it is one of the
finest cities of Europe. It has nearly 400,000 inhabitants,
and is the centre of Hungary’s political, cultural,
industrial, and commercial life. Fine public
and private buildings, some of them beautiful specimens
of architectural art, adorn the city, and it
boasts wide thoroughfares, among which the delightful
Corso along the left bank of the Danube,
and the Andrássy Út (Road) leading to the city
park, where the national exhibition of 1885 was
located, deserve especial mention. The finest and
largest cities, besides Buda-Pesth, are: Presburg
(Pozsony), on the left bank of the Danube, formerly
the seat of the Hungarian Diet; Comorn (Komárom),
on the Danube, too, celebrated for its grand
fortifications; Stuhlweissenburg (Székesfejérvár),
once the capital of Hungary; Raab (Györ); Oedenburg
(Soprony); Veszprém, one of the oldest cities;
Erlau (Eger), renowned for its excellent wine;
Szeged, the metropolis of the Alföld and one of
the largest cities, which in 1879 was almost entirely
destroyed by the overflowing of the Theiss,
but has since been rebuilt, more beautifully than before,
after the latest European pattern; Kassa, the
finest city in Upper Hungary; Miskolcz; Debreczen,
one of the most remarkable cities of the Hungarian
Alföld and the seat of a considerable industry;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a><br /><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>Grosswardein (Nagy-Várad), the scene of many
important historical events; Arad, Temesvár, and
Carlsburg (Gyulafejérvár), all fortified cities memorable
in history; Klausenburg (Kolozsvár), the capital
of the former principality of Transylvania; the
flourishing Transylvanian towns of Kronstadt
(Brassó) and Hermannstadt (Szeben), inhabited for the
most part by the descendants of Saxons; Fiume, the
seaport on the Adriatic; Agram (Zágráb), the capital
of Croatia, a beautiful city, which, however, was
greatly damaged in 1880 by a terrible earthquake;
and Eszék, the most prominent of the Slavonian
towns.</p>

<p>The population of the country is composed of various
nationalities. The conquering Hungarians did
not oppress the ancient inhabitants of the land but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
left them undisturbed in the use of their native language,
and, even in later days, their tolerance went
so far as to actually favor foreign, and, more particularly,
German immigrants, and to this exceptional
forbearance alone must be traced the survival of
so many nationalities, and the lack of assimilation,
after so many centuries. Classified as to languages
spoken by the inhabitants, the chief nationalities
number as follows: 1, Hungarians or Magyars,
6,500,000—the ruling, and, so to say, the political
nationality of the country, their language, the
Magyar,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">*</a> being the language of the state; 2, Germans,
1,900,000; 3, Roumans, 2,400,000; 4, Slovaks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>1,800,000; 5, Croats and Serbs, 2,400,000; 6, Ruthenes,
350,000. Besides these there are other nationalities
but in insignificant numbers.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">*</span></a> The language of the Hungarians, or Magyars, belongs to the Uralo-Altaic
stock, and must be classified with those mixed languages which
have sprung up from the amalgamation of different branches of the
said race. In the case of the Hungarian language we have before us
a mixture of the Finnic-Ugrian and the Turco-Tartar idioms, and the
question of its fundamental basis has been constantly a matter of dispute
between philologists.</p>

<p>Its phonetic system, as a strictly Asiatic language, being essentially
different from that of the Indo-European or Aryan languages, we give
here the following rules of pronunciation to be used in this book:</p>

<p>The relative numbers of the various religious denominations
are, in round figures, as follows: Roman
and Greek (united) Catholics 60%; Eastern-Greek
(non-united), 16%; Lutherans, 7%; Calvinists, 13%;
Unitarians, 1/3 %; Jews, 4%.</p>

<p>With respect to their cultural condition, the people
may be said to be abreast of the nations of
Western Europe in every thing but industry, commerce,
and some branches of science. In recent
years especially a great improvement has taken
place in popular education, owing to the large and
daily increasing number of schools, and the law
which compels children to attend school. There
are, for the purpose of advancing learning and cultivating
the various branches of science, a variety of
conspicuous scientific institutions, literary societies,
reading clubs, and public and private libraries. In
journalistic literature the country is equal to any
country on the European continent.</p>

<p>The constitution of the kingdom is one of the most
liberal in Europe. The estates were represented at
the Diet up to 1848, but under the present constitution
the government is based upon popular representation.
The Parliament or National Assembly consists
of two Houses, the House of Representatives
and the Upper House, or House of Lords, and in
these two bodies and the king is vested the legislative
power. The national affairs are administered
by eight ministerial departments; the affairs in
common with Austria are settled by a delegation
from the two Houses of Parliament which meets an
Austrian Parliamentary delegation once in every
year, and administered by three common ministerial
departments—for foreign affairs, for the common
army, and for the finances, respectively.</p>

<p>In conclusion it may be added that the description
given above of the favorable concurrence of soil
and climate is fully borne out by the abundance of
fine cattle of every description possessed by the
country, by a bountiful production of cereals which
has earned for Hungary the name of the granary of
Europe, by the growth of the greatest variety of
fruit and forest trees, and finally by the rich products
of the mining regions we have adverted to before.</p>

<p>This chapter, however, would be incomplete were
we not to mention the gigantic efforts made by the
national government in every direction during the
last two decades to raise Hungary from a mere
agricultural state to an industrial and commercial
state as well, by fostering her domestic industries
and providing good highways, a fine net of railways,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
steam and other navigation, in order to afford an
easy and cheap outlet to the abundance of natural
products with which nature has blessed her.</p>

<p>These patriotic efforts, considering the short space
of time they cover, have been attended with signal
success, and have culminated in the National Exhibition
of 1885, held at Buda-Pesth, which fitly
illustrated to its many visitors, amounting to nearly
a million, the extraordinary progress made by the
country in the last years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />

<small>HUNGARY BEFORE THE OCCUPATION BY THE
MAGYARS.</small></h2>

<p>The historic period of Hungary begins, properly
speaking, with the first century before our era, when
Pannonia, comprising the regions watered by the
Danube and Drave, was conquered by the victorious
arms of Rome. Prehistoric traces, however, may be
met with in abundance, which, with the aid of archæological
inquiry, indicate that the soil of Hungary
was already inhabited in the neolithic age and in that
of bronze by populations who, judged by the mementoes
left behind them, which were unearthed by
the present generation, must have stood on the same
level of civilization as the rest of Europe at those
periods. Certain articles dating from the age of
bronze show even such marked national peculiarities
as to lead to the supposition that the heterogeneous
tribes were all under the influence of one kind of
culture. The Pannonians, after a protracted struggle,
were subjugated by Tiberius, the stepson of
the emperor Augustus. One of the art gems of
antiquity, the so-called <i>Apotheosis of Augustus</i>, to
be seen in the museum of antiquities at Vienna,
commemorates the triumph of Tiberius. The con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a><br /><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>quering
general is represented as stepping from his
chariot to do homage to Augustus and Livia, who
are seated on a throne in godlike forms. Below,
Roman soldiers are raising trophies, whilst the conquered
leader is sitting on the ground with his arms
tied behind his back. The reduction of the Dacians,
to whose realm Transylvania belonged, took place
under Trajan, a century later. To this day stands
in Rome the pillar of Trajan, erected in memory of
his successful campaign in Dacia.</p>

<span class="caption">ROMAN AND DACIANS, FROM TRAJAN’S COLUMN.</span></a></div>

<p>In Trajan’s time already Pannonia differed in no
wise from the other Roman provinces. Under a
Roman administration the language of Rome soon
gained ground, although the legions placed there
were by no means Roman or even Italian, but consisted
for the most part of Romanized Spaniards,
Belgians, Britons, and inhabitants of the Alpine
provinces. The towns became municipalities and
colonies, and their inhabitants enjoyed the privilege
of self-government conceded to every Roman
citizen. Dacia, too, became, under that name, a
Roman province, and the Romanizing process was
no less rapid there than it had been in Pannonia.
The blessings of Roman civilization followed, as
usual, in the train of Roman conquests. Cities soon
sprang up in the newly organized provinces, and
were connected with each other as well as with
Rome by fine highways, traces of which may be met
with here and there to this day. The cultivation of
the vine was introduced under Roman rule, and the
regular working of the gold and salt mines of Transylvania
began at that period. The life in the prov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>inces
was modelled after the Roman pattern, for
the Roman brought with him his customs, institutions,
language, and mode of life. The newly
built cities boasted of public places, of amphitheatres,
of public baths, the resort of pleasure-seekers
and idlers; nor was the forum with its
statues wanting. The border towns had their <i>castrum</i>,
giving them a peculiar character of their own.</p>

<img src="images/i_042.png" width="400" height="421" alt="A ROMAN TEMPLE." />
<span class="caption">A ROMAN TEMPLE.</span></a></div>

<p>For four centuries these provinces shared the
destinies of the Roman empire. The enemies of
Rome were their enemies, too, and when, under the
emperor Marcus Aurelius, in the latter part of the
second century of our era, the German nations combined
in an attack on the Romans, the Marcomanni,
who were renowned for their savage bravery, made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
successful inroad into Pannonia, and crossing the
Danube devastated the whole land. Commodus,
the son of Marcus Aurelius, was satisfied to maintain
only the integrity of the vast possessions he inherited,
and was averse to new conquests in the
direction of the Carpathians. His policy was to
protect and defend the natural boundary line
formed by the Danube, a policy which gave the
legions located there an undue prominence. From
this time forth Rome had to be defended in Pannonia,
for already at that period the mighty revolution,
called the migration of nations—the pressing
forward of populations from the North and East
toward the civilized West and South—began to be
felt. It was quite natural that the Pannonian legions
should, under the circumstances, become aware of
the importance of their position, and undertake to
direct the destinies of Rome from that distant province.
Roman history records that it was by the proclamation
of these legions that Septimius Severus,
Maximin, and Aurelian became emperors. The emperors
Claudius II., Probus, and Valentinian I. were
of Pannonian origin. The infant son of the latter,
Valentinian II., was brought by the widowed empress
Justina into the camp, and there the legions
swore allegiance to him.</p>

<p>The time was now approaching when the waning
power of the Roman empire became more and more
unequal to the task of defending her provinces.
Aurelian already had withdrawn the Roman legions
from Dacia and allowed the Goths to settle
there, and Probus had introduced the Goths into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Lower Pannonia. Roman influence and Roman
protection began to be of little value; the great
empire, weakened by internal dissensions, by the
internecine wars waged against each other by imperial
pretenders, torn by religious disputes, and
finally divided, hastened to its downfall.</p>

<p>At this period a new people made its appearance
in Europe on the shores of the Black Sea and along
the banks of the Danube, namely, the Huns, who
were pushing before them the Goths towards the
West. They differed in race from the Germans,
Slavs, and Romans, and they had in Attila a leader
capable of uniting under his sway the most discordant
ethnical elements. Ostrogoths, Gepidæ,
Vandals, Alans, Rugians, mostly Germanic populations,
followed the banners of the foreign leader,
trusting in his good fortune and awed and magnetized
by his great personal qualities. He pushed forward
with an immense number of followers, gathering
strength as he advanced by the accession of the
barbarous nations, bearing down and destroying
every thing before him. Theodosius II., Emperor of
the East, agreed to pay tribute to the king of the
Huns; but in order to disguise to his subjects
the disgraceful transaction, he appointed Attila a
general of the empire, so that the tribute should
have the appearance of official pay. But Attila
was not satisfied with this, and broke the peace,
overran the Balkan peninsula, pillaged the Byzantine
provinces, and destroyed the cities until he obtained
his own terms. Priscus Rhetor, who was one of the
embassy sent by Theodosius II. to the court of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Attila, describes the wooden structure in which the
king of the Huns dwelt on the banks of the Theiss,
somewhere in the vicinity of Szeged, and the feasting
there. Kings sat at the table, lords sang Attila’s
heroic deeds, and the guests drank each other’s health
from vessels of gold. Heathen and Christian, Roman
citizens and Asiatic barbarians, as well as the representatives
of the Germanic tribes, mixed with each
other and thronged his court. It was during one of
those feasts, in 453, as he was celebrating his nuptials,
that the mighty king of the Huns was carried
off by a fit of apoplexy. Whilst the sons of Attila
were contending with each other for the possession
of the empire, the Germanic populations fell
upon the divided Huns and drove them back to the
Black Sea.</p>

<p>The Gepidæ remained now the masters of the
country east of the Danube, whilst the Ostrogoths
occupied the ancient Roman province. The latter,
however, under the lead of their king Theodoric,
migrated in a body to Italy, crossing the Alps, and
founded there, on the ruins of the Roman empire, a
Gothic kingdom. The Gepidæ remained in consequence
the sole ruling people in Hungary; but as
they proved dangerous neighbors to the Eastern
empire, Justinian invited the Longobards to settle in
Pannonia, and gave to the Avars, who now made their
first appearance in Europe and had asked him for
land to settle on, the left bank of the lower Danube.
About this time, too, Slavic populations came into
the country, crossing the Carpathian mountains and
peopling the deserted land. Gepidæ, Longobards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
and Avars could not dwell long in peace together,
and the first collision took place between the Longobards
and the Gepidæ on the banks of the Danube.
This was followed by another hostile outbreak, in
which the Longobards obtained the alliance of the
Avars against the Gepidæ, resulting in the total overthrow
of the latter. Shortly afterwards the Longobards,
following an invitation from Italy, emigrated
thither. Thus the Avars were left in sole possession
of the country, ruling over populations chiefly
Slavic. The empire they founded lasted two
centuries and a half. The Avars were partly remnants
of those Huns who had been the terror of
Europe, and their numbers were in part swelled by
new recruits coming from Asia.</p>

<p>Baján was the first and most dreaded prince of the
Avars. During his reign of thirty-two years the
Byzantine emperor was compelled to conciliate the
warlike humor of the Avar prince by an annual
tribute of splendid presents, which, however, did
not prevent the latter from undertaking pillaging expeditions,
on more than one occasion, into Thrace,
Mœsia, and Macedonia. Although a warlike people
the Avars seemed to lack the necessary skill and experience
for besieging and capturing fortified places.
Their rule was characterized by cruelty, want of
faith, and destructive propensities. In course of
time they became more inclined to peace; wealth,
indulgence in wine, and commerce having rendered
them effeminate and less formidable. They were
finally conquered, towards the end of the eighth
century, by Charlemagne and his Franks, who car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>ried
on against them for seven years one of the most
cruel and desolating wars known to history. Charlemagne’s
own historiographer tells us that one might
have travelled through the entire land for months,
after the termination of the war, without meeting
with a single house—so utter and terrible were the
ruin and destruction. The downfall of the Avars
was irretrievable.</p>

<p>The rule of the Romans had lasted four hundred
years in Pannonia; the Huns, Ostrogoths, Gepidæ,
and Longobards enjoyed a span of power of a little
over a century taking them altogether, whilst the
Avars maintained their supremacy for two hundred
and fifty years.</p>

<p>A century after their downfall appeared on the
scene the Magyars, who founded an empire which
still endures, having survived the storms of a thousand
years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br /><br />

<small>THE ORIGIN OF THE HUNGARIANS.</small></h2>

<p>The story of the origin of the Hungarians is generally
derived from two different sources. One, purely
mythical or legendary, is said to have come down
from the forefathers to the present generation, and,
clad in a somewhat fanciful garb, runs as follows:</p>

<p>Nimrod, the man of gigantic stature, a descendant
of Japheth, one of the sons of Noah, migrated after
the confusion of languages at the building of the
tower of Babel to the land of Havila. There his wife,
Eneh, bore him two sons, Hunyor and Magyar. One
day as the two brothers were out hunting in the forests
of the Caucasus, they happened to fall in with
a doe. They at once gave chase, but on reaching
the moorlands of the Sea of Azov the noble animal
suddenly vanished before their very eyes. The
brothers, in pursuing the track of their game,
had wandered through a wide expanse of country,
and perceiving that the rich meadows were admirably
suited to the needs of a pastoral people, they
immediately returned to their father and asked his
consent to their departure. They obtained his consent
without difficulty, and settled with their herds
of cattle in those regions where grass grew luxuriantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>The two brothers had lived quietly for five years
in their new homes, when the thought occurred to
them, more thoroughly to investigate the surrounding
country. They accordingly set out on their
journey, roaming along the steppes, when their ears
were suddenly caught by the sounds of voices singing,
which the east wind had wafted in their direction.
Led on by the pleasing sounds the wanderers’ eyes
were met by a lovely sight. Before them the daughters
of the dwellers in the woods were disporting
themselves beneath their tents, celebrating the Feast
of the Hunting-horn, in the absence of their husbands
and brothers. Hunyor and Magyar were delighted
at this unexpected encounter and quickly
carried away the women to their own abode.
Amongst the ravished women were two maids of
rare beauty, the daughters of Dula, the prince of the
Alans. Hunyor took one, and Magyar the other,
for his spouse. From them sprang the kindred nations
of the Huns and Magyars, or Hungarians, both
of which in due course of time, grew to be mighty.</p>

<p>After the lapse of many years the descendants of
the two brothers had increased to such an extent
that the territory they dwelt in proved too small to
support them all. North of their homes lay blessed
Scythia, bounded on the east by the Ural mountains,
on the southeast by the sandsteppes, rich in salt,
and the Caspian Sea, and on the south by the Don
river. After having thoroughly reconnoitred this
country they drove out the inhabitants, one portion
of the people spreading over their newly acquired
home and taking possession of it, whilst the remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>ing
portion continued to occupy their former country.
The progeny of Hunyor settled in the northeastern
part of the country beyond the Volga, whilst the
descendants of Magyar, pushing upwards along the
Don, pitched their tents on the left bank of the
river. The latter were afterwards known by the
name of the Don-Magyars, and their country by
that of Dontumogeria—that is, the Don Magyarland.</p>

<p>In proportion as the two kindred races increased
and came in contact with various other nations,
they began to differ from each other more and
more widely in their ways and manners. The
Huns being more exposed to the attacks of the
roving populations than the Magyars, who were
protected by the Caspian Sea and endless steppes,
became, in consequence, more warlike, and adopted
ruder manners. Twenty-two generations had passed
away since the death of the two brothers, who had
been the founders of their nations, when for reasons
unknown the Huns resolved to emigrate from
their country. Whilst the Magyars continued to
dwell quietly along the Don, the Huns proceeded
with an immense army, each tribe contributing ten
thousand men, against Western Europe, conquering
and rendering tributary, in the course of their wanderings,
numerous nations, and finally settled in the
region of the Theiss and Danube. Later on, however,
in the middle of the fifth century, when the
world-renowned Attila, “the scourge of God,” came
into power, the Huns carried their victorious arms
over a great part of the western world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>The immense empire, however, which had been
founded by King Attila, was destined to be but of
short duration after the death of its founder. His
sons Aladar and Csaba, in their contention for the
inheritance, resorted to arms. The war ended with
the utter destruction of the nation. All of the
followers of Aladar perished; Csaba, however, succeeded
in escaping from the destroying arms of the
neighboring nations who had fallen on the quarrelling
brothers, with but about fifteen thousand men
to the territories of the Greek empire. A few thousands,
who had deserted Csaba, fled to Transylvania,
and settled there in the eastern mountain-regions.
The descendants of the latter became subsequently
merged with the immigrating Hungarians, and formed
with them a homogeneous family under the name of
Szeklers, which continues to exist to this day. Csaba,
whose mother was an imperial daughter of Greece,
met with a friendly reception at the hands of the
Greek emperor, Marcianus, and remained in that
country for a few years. He returned afterwards
with the remainder of his people to the home of his
ancestors, on the banks of the Don, where, up to
the time of his death, he never tired of inciting the
Magyars to emigrate to Pannonia and to revenge
themselves on their enemies by reconquering the
empire of Attila.</p>

<span class="caption">HUNGARIAN SHEPHERD.</span></a></div>

<p>In turning to the second source of the history of
the origin of the Hungarians, we are treading upon
the firmer ground of scientific inquiry; we can
penetrate the hazy light of remote antiquity, and
venture the assertion that it is far away in the dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a><br /><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>tant
East—namely, in the Altai mountains, that we
may look for the cradle of the Magyar race. Here
was, as the reader may be aware, the coterminous
frontier of the three principal branches of the Uralo-Altaic
race—namely, the Mongolians in the east,
the Finn-Ugrians in the north, and the Turks in
the south. With a population of strictly nomadic
habits and of eminently roaming propensities, it
needs scarcely to be said that the three branches
lived in continual feud and warfare near each other.
A great convulsion in the life of these nomads
happened, as we presume, in the second or third
century after Christ. The Turks, on seeing the
more flourishing state of things with their Finn-Ugrian
neighbors in the north, fell upon them suddenly,
drove them from their homes in the valleys
of the Altai mountains, where traces of their industry
are still extant, and scattered the various tribes
and families, partly to the north—namely, to Siberia;
partly to the west—namely, to Southern Russia.</p>

<p>From that extraordinary throng and revolutionary
migration emerged the Voguls and Ostyaks, who
live at this day on both sides of the great Obi river;
the Zyrians, who now live in the governments of
Archangel and Vologda; farther the Votyaks and
Tcheremisses, a motley crowd of men who are of
Finn-Ugrian extraction, but strongly intermixed
with Turco-Tartar blood.</p>

<p>Now, of similar origin are the Hungarians, with
this difference, that with them the Turco-Tartar
origin forms the basis of their ethnical character,
and that the Finn-Ugrians who amalgamated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
them afterward, being a subjugated population, remained
always in a moral inferiority, although they
greatly influenced the governing class. We do not
know precisely whether the amalgamation took place
in the valleys of the Altai, or farther west on the
Volga, at some later period, nor can we form an accurate
idea as to the part the Hungarians took in the
irruption of the Huns, with which event they are
associated in national tradition. The Huns were
unquestionably Turks by extraction. Their mode of
warfare, their religion, and social life present full evidence
of this, and admitting that they had in their
ranks either pure Finn-Ugrian elements or portions
of the above-mentioned amalgamated populations,
we may fairly claim that the ancestors of the Hungarians
took part in the great devastating campaigns
which Attila carried on against Rome and the Christian
West as far as France. In this sense, the claim
of the Hungarians to descent from the Huns is fully
justified. But, as the plan of this work excludes the
discussion of questions wrapped in the clouds of scientific
speculations we will turn to that portion of the
history of the Hungarians which is cleared up by historical
evidence, and will begin with the ninth century,
when they emerged from the banks of the Volga and
began their march toward the West, a march which
resulted in their occupation of Hungary.</p>

<p>Before entering into the details of the march of
the Magyars towards their present home, we must
try to sketch as briefly as possible the geographical
and ethnographical conditions of the country
between the Volga and the Danube in the ninth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
century. It must be borne in mind that at that
time the Russians were in a considerable minority in
those regions. East of the Volga, as far as the Ural
River, and even beyond, roamed various tribes of the
vast Turkish race, amongst whom the Petchenegs occupied
the foremost rank. On the lower course of
the Volga and further west, lived the Khazars, a
Turkish tribe of advanced culture, who carried on
a flourishing trade on the Caspian and Black seas,
and had embraced the Jewish religion. These Khazars
were the mightiest of the Turkish races of that
time, and their wars with Persia and with the rising
Mohammedan power became of historic importance.
Westward of the Khazars dwelt another fraction of
the Petchenegs, the frontiers of whose country extended
across Moldavia to the borders of Transylvania,
whilst the Magyars or Hungarians, who had
occupied a country called Lebedia, were compelled
by the Petchenegs to emigrate to Etelkuzu, not remaining
there, however, for any great length of
time. In fact the whole of Southern Russia of to-day
was teeming, during the ninth century, with
nomadic populations. These pressed upon each
other in the search for pasture grounds for their
numerous cattle. There is a great likelihood that
the fame of the rich plains of Hungary had remained
in the memory of the Magyars from the time when
their forefathers fought under the banners of Attila.
Suffice it to say that, compelled by circumstances,
they made up their minds to go westward, and the
seven dukes who stood at that time at the head of
the nation, and whose names were Álmos, Elöd,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a><br /><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>Kund, Huba, Tas, Und, and Tuhutum, united in a
solemn league and covenant, and putting Álmos, as
the oldest amongst them, at their head, they sealed
that union with the old Turkish form of oath, by
drinking each of the blood of all, obtained by cutting
open the veins of their arms. This form of oath
was for a long time a custom in Hungary. The union
of the Hungarians was based upon the following five
conditions:</p>

<p>1. As long as they and their progeny after them
shall live, their duke and ruler shall be always taken
from the house of Álmos.</p>

<p>2. Whatever should be acquired by the united
strength of all must benefit all those who belonged
to them.</p>

<p>3. The chiefs of the people having voluntarily
elected Álmos for their ruler, they and their descendants
shall always take part in the councils of the
prince, and shall have their share in the honors of
the empire.</p>

<p>4. Whenever any of their descendants shall be
found wanting in the fidelity due to the prince, or
shall foment dissensions between him and his kindred,
the blood of the guilty one shall be shed
even as theirs was flowing when they gave their
oaths of fidelity to Álmos.</p>

<p>5. Should a successor of Álmos offend against this
oath and covenant of the fathers, then might the
curse rest on him.</p>

<span class="caption">ELECTION OF ÁLMOS, THE FIRST DUKE.</span></a></div>

<p>We have no accurate information concerning the
number of Hungarian warriors and of their retinues
who entered Hungary towards the end of the ninth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
century, nor can we point out those localities on the
eastern frontier of the country through which the
entrance was effected. As to the numbers, we do
not go amiss if we assume that no more than one
hundred and fifty thousand fighting men formed the
main body of the invaders. Their ranks were
swelled partly by Russians who followed in their
track, partly by Avars, a kindred Turkish population,
whom they found in the country itself, and by
Khazars, who, preceding the Hungarians, were leading
a nomadic life on the steppe. Regarding the
country itself, it must be borne in mind that in those
days it was very thinly populated, and the ethnical
conditions were somewhat as follows: In the west
there were Slovenes and Germans; in the north,
namely, in the Carpathian mountains, lived the compact
mass of the Slovaks, whose sway extended
down to the banks of the Theiss. The country
between that river and the Danube belonged to the
Bulgarian prince, Zalán, whilst the region on the left
bank of the Theiss, as far as the river Szamos, was
in the possession of Marót, the prince of the Khazars.
The conquest of Hungary was evidently a task of no
great difficulty for a warlike nation like the Hungarians,
whose strange physiognomy and superior
weapons, brought from the Caucasus, struck terror, at
the very outset, into the breasts of the inhabitants.
The invaders appeared with their small, sturdy,
and hardy horses, quick as lightning and strong as
iron. Their mode of warfare was strictly Asiatic,
similar to that used to this day by the Turcomans,
and they were animated precisely by the same spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
which led the Mongolians, under Jenghis Khan,
over the whole of Asia and a large portion of Europe.
With all this, they could not be called barbarians or
savages, when their social and political institutions
were compared with those of the inhabitants they
subjugated in Hungary. It was the culture of Persia
which extended at that time up to the banks of the
Volga, penetrating the minds of the motley populations
living there, and traces of this culture are
clearly to be discovered in the acts of the leading
persons amongst the conquering Hungarians. As
soon as the Hungarians had taken possession of their
present country, under the leadership of Árpád, it
became their chief care to give a certain stability to
their internal affairs. Scattered over the extensive
territory, they more particularly endeavored to bring
order into their relations with the former inhabitants.
Those only who refused to lay down their arms felt
the weight of the conquerors; whilst they reciprocated
the friendship and confidence shown to them
by others. Thus it happened that many of the
ancient inhabitants were adopted by them for their
own countrymen, and that, having entered into a
treaty of amity with Marót, a treaty made firmer by
the betrothal of Árpád’s youngest son, Zoltán, with
Marót’s daughter, the territory of Bihar was added
to Hungary after the death of Marót. According to
the fashion of the Scythian populations, they disturbed
no one in his faith, nor did they interfere with
any one’s mode of worship. Nomads as they were,
they knew how to appreciate what was still left of
the ancient culture in their new country, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
fostered the colonial places still surviving from the
Roman period, the cradles of the future city life of
Hungary.</p>

<p>There is an account in the history of the Hungarians
how the different portions of the invading
army spread over the country, what battles they
fought, what alliances they entered into with the
reigning princes, but the account is based merely
upon legendary tradition. We are sadly in want of
details about that most interesting epoch, and supported
by historical authority we can only state that
Leo the Wise, the emperor of Byzantium, asked the
military assistance of the Hungarians against the
Bulgarians, and that it was the sword of the valiant
nomadic warriors which averted a threatening calamity
from Constantinople. It is likewise certain
that Arnulph, King of Germany, encouraged by the
military reputation of the Magyars, asked their assistance
against Svatopluk, King of Moravia, and
that their first appearance in the country is connected
with this occurrence.</p>

<p>The conquest of Hungary occupied the period between
884 and 895.</p>

<p>Within this time falls the utter defeat and tragic
end of Svatopluk, the most powerful native prince
with whom the Hungarians had to contend. Arnulph
had already engaged him in battle when the
Hungarians came to the succor of the former. Their
timely arrival decided the fate of the battle, which
resulted in the complete rout and scattering of the
Moravians. Svatopluk, is said to have done wonders
of heroism during the battle, but after its fatal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
termination he could nowhere be found. In vain
was the bloody field searched for the body of the
unfortunate leader, nor were the messengers sent
out to remoter regions to obtain news of him more
successful in their quest. Hungarian tradition
has it that in his rage and despair at the loss
of the battle, he rushed into the Danube, and
met there with a watery grave. Slavic tradition,
however, represents the matter in a manner more
in keeping with the character and reckless disposition
of this strange barbarian, who knew but unbridled
passions and sudden resolutions formed on the
spur of the moment. According to these traditions,
Svatopluk, seeing that his fortunes were hopelessly
wrecked, mounted a steed and, leaving the battle-field,
swiftly rode away into the fastnesses of the interminable
forests covering the Zobor mountain, which overlooks
in massive grandeur towards the east and south
the town and castle of Nyitra, and was then lost to
sight. Here in a secluded valley, amidst rocks, and protected
by pathless woods, lived three hermits. These
holy men passed their lives in offering up prayers to
God in a chapel constructed by their own hands, and,
entirely absorbed by their pious exercises, they knew
no other nourishment but herbs and the fruit growing
wild. These men, who did not visit the neighboring
cities, had never seen Svatopluk, and this was
the very reason that brought the king of the Moravians
to their hermitage. As he reached late in the
night a place where the forest was densest, he dismounted,
killed his horse, and, together with his royal
mantle and crown, buried it in a ditch, and covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
up the place of burial with earth and leaves. He
then tore his garments and soiled them with mud,
and in this guise, pretending to be a beggar, he came
to the three hermits and told them that, moved by
the Holy Spirit, he desired to pass his life with them.
He was cordially received by the hermits and lived
amongst them a great many years unknown, praying
as they did, partaking of the same food they ate, and
like them dead to all the memories of the outside
world. In his last moments only he told them his
real name, and the hermits, in their childlike astonishment
at this incredulous adventure, placed the
following inscription on his tombstone: “Here rests
Svatopluk, the king of Moravia, buried in the centre
of his kingdom.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>THE REIGN OF THE DUKES.</small></h2>

<p>Árpád, called by the Greek writers Arpadis, was
the first ruler of Hungary, who laid the foundations
of the present kingdom, and whose statesmanlike
sagacity may well excite admiration, considering that
under his lead a strictly Asiatic nation succeeded in
penetrating into the very interior of Christian
Europe and moulding a state out of the heterogeneous
elements of old Pannonia. For this reason we
find it improper to call him a rude barbarian, as contemporary
Christian writers are in the habit of doing.
He evidently was penetrated with the Persian
culture and his Oriental statesmanship not only
equalled but even surpassed the political ideas of
the ruling men at that time at the head of affairs
in Pannonia and Eastern Germany. Arriving, as
he did, with a restless and adventurous nomadic
people; he could not mitigate at once the martial
rudeness of the latter. Like other Turkish and
Mongolian masses the Hungarians, very soon after
the occupation of the country, rushed out into the
neighboring lands to gratify their lust of adventure
and booty. They penetrated into Germany, spreading
terror and devastation everywhere. On a larger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a><br /><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>scale was their inroad into Italy in 899, where King
Berengar was defeated on the banks of the Brenta.
Twenty thousand Italians were slain, the wealthy
cities of Milan, Pavia, and Brescia were plundered,
and the invaders crossed even the Po. It was only
by the payment of a large ransom that the Italians
could free themselves from the scourge of these
Asiatic conquerors. Encouraged by this success the
Hungarians, in the following year, entered Germany,
trying their arms with varying fortune, until a common
decision of the chieftains arrested these incursions.
In 907 the nation was saddened by a mournful
event. The ruler who had founded the new empire,
who for nearly twenty years had directed the
destinies of the nation with so much wisdom and
energy, and in whom the glory of great statesmanship
and generalship was united, had ceased to be
amongst the living. His body was, according to
ancient custom, burned and his ashes buried near a
brook flowing at that time in a pebbly bed towards
Etzelburg, the Old-Buda of to-day. His grateful
descendants, after the introduction of Christianity,
erected on that spot a church, called the White
Church of the Virgin, in commemoration of the immortal
prince. He was succeeded by his son Zoltán,
who had to seize the reins at a comparatively
tender age, and who was therefore assisted by three
governors. This circumstance encouraged the neighboring
princes to fall upon Hungary in order to
drive the new conquerors out of the country. Luitpold,
Duke of Bavaria, and Ditmar, Archbishop of
Salzburg, together with others, led the united army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
in three different columns, flattering themselves with
the hope that, imitating the tactics of Charlemagne
against the Avars, they would be as successful as
that famous ruler of the Franks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="i064" id="i064">

<span class="caption">ÁRPÁD TAKES POSSESSION OF HUNGARY.</span></a></div>

<p>The Hungarians, menaced by such an imminent
danger, concentrated all their forces to resist the
onslaught. Always quick to resolve and as quick in
their movements, they anticipated the attack, and
the two hostile armies met in 907 in the environs
of Presburg. The struggle on both sides was a
bitter one. The zeal of the Germans, on the one
hand, was excited by the prospect of ridding themselves
and the whole Occident of the disagreeable
neighborhood of these dangerous intruders, whilst
with the Hungarians, on the other hand, it was a
question of self-preservation, for in case of a defeat
they had every thing at stake. The latter, therefore,
fought with the utmost vehemence, not in regular
battle array, after the German fashion, but with their
storming divisions, furious attacks, feigned retreats,
and renewed onslaughts, their arrows and javelins
descending every time like a hail-storm, they broke
through the serried ranks of the Germans and rode
down every thing that was in their way. The sun
rose and set three times over the heads of the fighting
armies before the great battle was decided. The
Germans were hopelessly defeated. Duke Luitpold
lost his life fighting, and with him the Archbishop of
Salzburg, as well as most of the bishops, abbots, and
counts, laid down their lives during those three fatal
days.</p>

<p>It was but natural that, encouraged by this success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>ful
battle, the Hungarians should eagerly continue
their marauding expeditions in every direction into
Germany and even France. Dividing into small
bands, just as the Turcomans used to do up to quite
recent times in Persia, the Hungarians infested the
whole of Saxony and Thuringia, and penetrated as far
as Bremen. They crossed the Rhine, flooded a part
of France, and quick as were their inroads, no less
promptly did they return, always laden with rich
booty and driving before them a long file of slaves
of both sexes. The entire Occident was continually
harassed by them, and this gave rise to those dire
misrepresentations of the Hungarians and to the execrations
against them which could be heard all over
the western world during the tenth century, and
which were faithfully copied into the chronicles of
that time. In these chronicles they were charged
with devouring the hearts of their enemies in order
to render themselves irresistible in battle. Signs in
the heavens were said to herald their approach.
Virgins devoted to the service of God foretold the
irruptions of the Hungarians and their own martyrdom.
Mere human power seemed hopeless against
them; the litanies of that time, therefore, abound in
special prayers asking for the protection of the Lord.
Impartial history easily recognizes in all this partly
exaggerations, partly outbreaks of dismay, and the
effects of fright, but these utterances, overdrawn as
they are, contribute much to our knowledge of the
violence of the struggle between the western Christians
and the Asiatic Hungarians. Quite differently
and by no means so dreadfully are the Hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>garians
described by the Byzantine historians. Their
reputation for ferocity, and the knowledge of the
terror they inspired, enhanced their valor and
audacity. Neglecting all precautionary measures,
and undervaluing their enemies, they began to meet
here and there with small disasters, and, as the
Germans on the other hand, becoming familiar with
their mode of warfare, and more accustomed to the
strange appearance of Asiatic warriors, grew bolder
and bolder, we may easily account for the turn which
gradually took place in the war fortunes of the Magyars.
It was Henry the Fowler, King of Germany,
who, after making preparations for nine years, inflicted
the first heavy loss upon the Hungarian adventurers
near Merseburg in 933. The Germans rushed into
the battle with the cry of “Kyrie eleyson,” whilst
the Hungarians were wildly shouting “Hooy, Hooy.”
The Saxon horsemen caught up the Hungarian
arrows with their shields, and in solid ranks threw
themselves in fierce onset upon the Hungarians.
The latter perceived with surprise and dismay that
they were opposed by a well-organized enemy.
During the hand-in-hand fight which now ensued
the Germans achieved victory by their determined
bravery. A great many Hungarians fell in the fight,
and many more were killed during their retreat.
The number of killed is assumed to have been
thirty-six thousand. The Hungarian camp with all
the baggage fell into the hands of the victors.
Henry commanded that a universal thanksgiving
feast should be observed throughout the whole of
Germany, and ordered that the tribute hitherto paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
to the Hungarians should be divided between the
churches and the poor.</p>

<p>The Hungarians now refrained from entering
Germany in a northern direction, but the more
frequent and more vehement grew their irruptions
into Bavaria and also into the northern portion of
the Byzantine empire. It was the old lust of conquest
and adventure, and greediness for booty which
spurred their activity. Duke Taksony, who succeeded
his father Zoltán in 946, and reigned until
972, was animated by the same lawless spirit, and
the Hungarians would have continued to be the
scourge of the neighboring countries if the defensive
measures taken by the Germans about this
time had not acted as a dam against their devastating
flood. In the year 955, on the river Lech,
near Augsburg, King Otto the Great inflicted a terrible
defeat upon the Hungarians—a defeat by which
nearly the whole of the Hungarian army, numbering
forty thousand men was annihilated. Their generals,
Bulcsee and Lehel were captured; the chains of gold
they wore around their necks, as well as other trinkets
of gold and silver, were taken from them, and at
last they were carried to Ratisbon, and were made to
suffer a disgraceful death by being hanged. A part
of their fellow captives were buried alive, whilst the
others were tortured to death in the most cruel manner.
The remainder of the army was destroyed in its
retreat by the people who had everywhere risen, and,
according to tradition, but seven were left to reach
their homes. The Magyars, a proud nation even in
their misfortune, were so incensed against these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
fugitives for having preferred a cowardly flight to a
heroic death, that they were scornfully nicknamed
the <i>Melancholy Magyars</i>, and condemned to servitude.
Even their descendants wandered about
through the land as despised beggars.</p>

<p>A tradition has survived amongst the people to
this day, about the death of Lehel and his reputed
ivory bugle-horn, upon which there are carved representations
of battles. It is true that archæological
inquiry has proved its sculpture to be of Roman
workmanship and that it was a drinking-cup rather
than a bugle. The legend, however, as still current
amongst the Hungarians, deserves to be told for the
sake of its romantic character.</p>

<p>Amidst the confusion and wild disorder incident
upon the disastrous battle of Augsburg, Duke Lehel
found no time to give thought to his battle-horn. His
horse had been killed under him, and whilst he lay
buried beneath it the trusty sword was wrenched
from the hand of the hero before he could pierce his
own heart with it. Taken prisoner he was led captive
into the presence of the victorious Otto.</p>

<p>Princely judges sat in judgment on the princely
captive and condemned him to death. This sentence
caused Lehel no pain; he felt he had deserved it, not,
indeed, for having given battle but for losing it. Yet
it hurt him to the soul to see the rebel Conrad seated
amongst his judges, the traitor who had invited the
Hungarians to enter Germany, and who, by his defection,
had caused their defeat. The success of his dastardly
desertion had, however, conciliated the victors
and restored him to their confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>Lehel begged but for one favor, and that was to be
allowed to wind the horn, his faithful and inseparable
friend, once more, and to sound on it his funeral
dirge. The horn was handed to him. He sounded
it for the last time; and, as he drew from it the sad
strains which sounded far and wide and were mournfully
re-echoed by the distant hills, the dying warrior
on the field of Lech lifted up his head, eagerly listening
to the familiar bugle, and the soul which had
come back to him, for one instant, took wings again as
soon as the sad strains died away. The dying music,
plaintively quivering, told the tale of an inglorious
death terminating an heroic life. The very henchmen
were listening with rapture.</p>

<p>At that moment Lehel broke away from his place,
and, seeing Conrad before him, felled him to the
ground, killing him with a single blow from the
heavy horn. “Thou shalt go before me and be
my servant in the other world,” said Lehel. Thereupon
he went to the place of execution. There is
discernible on Lehel’s horn, in our days, a large indentation
which posterity attributes to the event
just narrated.</p>

<p>Not only in Germany but also in the southeast
of Europe the marauding Hungarians experienced
more than one disaster, and it may be properly said
that in 970, when they attacked the Byzantine empire
and were defeated near Arcadiopolis, their long
series of irruptions into the adjoining countries was
brought to a conclusion. They became convinced
that while they themselves were steadily decreasing
in numbers and wasting their strength in continu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>ous
wars, the neighboring nations were becoming
every day more formidable by dint of their unanimity,
organization, courage, and skill in warfare, and
that, in consequence, the Hungarian name inspired
no more the terror which the first successes had earned
for it. They saw that if they went on with their inroads,
as hitherto, they would thereby but bring
about the dissolution of the empire from within, or
that they might provoke on the part of foreign nations
a united attack which they would be unable to
withstand. For this reason they renounced those
adventurous campaigns which began already seriously
to menace their existence and their future
in Europe.</p>

<p>They were strengthened in the wisdom of this
course by Duke Geyza, who succeeded his father in
972, and reigned until 997. Baptized during the life
of his father at Constantinople, and having married
Sarolta, the mild-tempered daughter of Duke Gyula,
of Transylvania, he became very early awake
to the necessity of refining the rude manners of his
people. His disposition became much more apparent
when, after the death of his first wife, he married
the sister of Miecislas, the prince of Poland, a
lady famous for her beauty, and also conspicuous for
her energy and masculine qualities, for she vied in
riding, drinking, and the chase with her chivalrous
husband, upon whom she really exercised an extraordinary
influence. Extremely severe in his rule, it
was Geyza who began to transform the manners and
habits of the Magyars. They began to show greater
toleration towards foreign religions, and were really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
on the eve of changing their Asiatic manners and
habits into those of Europe. More than a hundred
years had passed since their migration from the ancestral
steppes. Historical events, difference of climate,
and, above all, the separation from their
Asiatic brethren had carried into oblivion very
many features of that political and social life
which, originating in Asia, could not be well continued
in the immediate neighborhood of, and in the
continual contact with, the Western world. The great
crisis in the national career appears to have arrived
at its culmination during the reign of Duke Geyza,
and to have found its ultimate solution in the conversion
of the Magyars to Christianity, a most important
act in the national life of the people, which
deserves consideration in a separate chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br/><br/>

<small>THE CONVERSION TO CHRISTIANITY.</small></h2>

<p>The Hungarians, when entering their present
homes, were heathens, and professed what is called
<i>Shamanism</i>, the faith common to all the branches
of the vast Uralo-Altaic race, and which has survived
to this day amongst the populations of Southern
Siberia and Western Mongolia. The doctrines and
principles of Shamanism being generally but little
known, it is proper to sketch here its outlines, in
order to make clear the character of the Hungarian
religious rites and customs.</p>

<p>The believers in Shamanism adored one Supreme
Being called <i>Isten</i>, a word borrowed from the Persians,
who attach to it to this day the meaning of
God. Besides the supreme being, they adored sundry
spirits or protecting deities, such as the gods of
the mountains, woods, springs, rivers, fire, thunder,
etc. These divinities were adored either by prayers
or through sacrifices offered to them in the recesses
of woods, or near springs. What these prayers of the
Hungarians were we do not know; we can form,
however, some idea of their character on reading the
prayers of the present Shaman worshippers, a specimen
of which is here subjoined:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
“O, thou God living above, Abiash!</div>
<div class="line">Who hast clad the earth with grass,</div>
<div class="line">Who hast given leaves to the tree,</div>
<div class="line">Who hast provided the calves with flesh,</div>
<div class="line">Who didst bring forth hair on the head,</div>
<div class="line">Who didst create all the creatures,</div>
<div class="line">Who prepares every thing present!</div>
<div class="line">Thou hast created the stars, O God!</div>

<div class="line">O, Ulgen Pi, who hast exalted the mother,</div>

<div class="line">Thou preparer of all that is prepared,</div>
<div class="line">O God, thou creator of the stars,</div>
<div class="line">O give us cattle, O God!</div>
<div class="line">Give food, O God!</div>
<div class="line">Give us a chief, O God!</div>
<div class="line">Thou preparer of all things prepared,</div>
<div class="line">Thou creator of all things created!</div>
<div class="line">I prayed to my Father</div>
<div class="line">To bestow on me his blessing,</div>
<div class="line">To give me help,</div>
<div class="line">To me, in my house,</div>
<div class="line">And to my cattle, in the herd!</div>
<div class="line">Before thee I bow down.</div>
<div class="line">Give thy blessing, O Kudai,</div>
<div class="line">Thou Creator of all things created,</div>
<div class="line">Thou preparer of all things prepared!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The sacrifices consisted in the offering up of cattle
and particularly, on solemn occasions, of white
horses. Their priests, called <i>Táltos</i>, occupied a pre-eminent
place, not only in the political but also in
the social life of the Magyars. They were a kind of
augurs and soothsayers, whose prophecies were based
either upon certain natural phenomena, or upon the
inspection of certain portions of slaughtered animals,
such as the intestines, the heart, and shoulder-blade,
which latter was put into the fire, good and bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
auspices being prognosticated from the different
positions of the cracks produced.</p>

<p>Religious faith being always open to outside or
foreign influence, it was but natural that the Hungarians,
in that long march from the interior of Asia
into Europe, should have borrowed many novel features
from the religious life of the countries through
which they passed. Thus, in the earlier faith of the
Magyars, we meet with many distinctive traits of the
Parsee religion, of that of the Khazars, and of the
religions of many Ugrian races, for, like other families
of the Uralo-Altaic race, the Magyars were
conspicuous for their spirit of toleration towards
other believers.</p>

<p>The numerous Christian prisoners they had
brought with them from various parts of Europe
were not only left in the undisturbed practice of
their creeds, but were even permitted to influence to
a very considerable degree the faith of their conquerors
and masters. Under these circumstances it
was by no means a hazardous undertaking, on the
part of Duke Geyza, to give permission to missionaries
and priests to come into the country and
preach the gospel. A Suabian monk named Wolfgang
was the first who tried to spread Christianity in
Hungary in 917. A greater success was achieved
by Pilgrin, the bishop of Passau, who, taking the
matter of conversion into his hands, was able to report
to the Pope in 974 that nearly five thousand
Hungarians had been baptized, and that “under the
benign influence of the miraculous grace of God
those heathens even who have remained in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
erring ways forbid no one the baptism, nor do they
interfere with the priests, allowing them to go where
they please. Christians and heathens dwell together
in such harmony that here the prophecy of Isaiah
seems to be fulfilled: ‘The wolf and the lamb shall
feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the
ox.’”</p>

<p>Considering the difficulty of turning inveterate
Asiatics to western views of life, and, particularly to
the totally different doctrines of the Christian religion,
we may easily realize that the total conversion
of the Magyars was a work attended with many
struggles and difficulties. After Pilgrin we find
Bruno engaged in the pious undertaking; but by
far the most successful of all of the missionaries was
St. Adalbert, the bishop of Prague, who came to the
country in 993, and, remaining there for a considerable
period of time, had the good fortune to baptize
several members of the reigning family, amongst
whom was the son of Duke Geyza, called Vayik, to
whom was given the Christian name of Stephen.
This conversion being regarded as one of the most
momentous events in the history of the Hungarians,
it will be worth while explaining the accompanying
illustration, representing this act. In the baptistry,
we perceive, as the principal personage, Stephen, in
his baptismal robes. Next to him is seen St. Adalbert,
robed and adorned in keeping with his episcopal
dignity and the apostolic office of conversion.
To the left in the foreground, as witnesses to the
baptism, are standing the Emperor of Germany,
Otto III., who was brought there by his friendship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a><br /><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>for Geyza and his interest in the baptism of Stephen,
and Count Teodato, of San Severino, a knight who
had emigrated from Apulia, and to whom Geyza had
entrusted the education of his son. Behind the latter
stands Duke Henry of Bavaria, who, attending
the emperor, is present as a guest. Farther in the
background we perceive Duke Geyza and his consort,
sunk in pious revery. We see Stephen after the act
of confessing his faith and knowledge of Christianity.
Already he had turned his face toward the west,
had renounced Satan and devoted himself to the
eternal war of the children of God, and then, turning
to the east, had vowed, with exalted enthusiasm,
obedience and devotion to the Law of God as revealed
through Christ. Now we see him, according
to the custom of the Church at that time, in the act
of descending into the baptismal font in order to
receive from the hands of the holy bishop the sign
of the Cross, the sacrament of spiritual regeneration.</p>

<span class="caption">BAPTISM OF ST. STEPHEN.<br />

<p>Pious emotion is reflected in the countenances of
the attendant Magyars, although there may be discernible
here and there the expression of a hidden
spirit of antagonism. And the supposition of such
an expression can, in no way, be called a groundless
one. The worship of God on the banks of rivers, in
woods and groves, the offering of sacrifices, and sundry
superstitions connected with the soothsaying of
the Shaman priests, certainly impressed more forcibly
the minds of the free and independent dwellers of the
steppes than the mass pronounced in Latin, and the
rites of the Catholic Church, introduced by the
monks and priests of the West. Conversion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Christianity had to be unconditionally followed up
not only by the relinquishment of the old national
religion, but also by the renunciation of the ancient
habits and manners, to which the Hungarians clung
in spite of the generations that had passed since
their coming to the banks of the Danube and
Theiss. The reluctance, shown here and there,
must be also ascribed to the overbearing attitude
assumed by the foreign missionaries towards the
ruling race of the Magyars, upon whom these Bavarians,
Suabians, Czechs, Italians, etc., looked down
as contemptible barbarians, a title they by no means
deserved, for it was only the difference in culture
and not the want of culture which separated the two
elements. Suffice it to say that traces of this discontent
became visible very early, and that the
slumbering spark broke out in open rebellion in 997,
in the very year when Stephen ascended the throne,
made vacant through the death of his father, Geyza.
History records three different risings, which took
place with the intention of doing away with the
newly introduced Christian religion, together with
all the changed modes of life borrowed from western
civilization. In the first instance the movement was
headed by Kopán, a nobleman in the county of
Sümeg. His object was to drive out the foreign
Christian missionaries and priests, to dethrone Stephen,
and to re-establish the old pagan faith. A
vast multitude of discontented Hungarians gathered
under his banners, but Stephen was not at all afraid.
Collecting his army and the foreign Christian knights
about him, he left his regal seat Gran (Esztergom),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
and marched on straight against the rebels. The
engagement took place in the vicinity of Veszprém.
It was a hard contested struggle, and only after a
bitter fight and the death of Kopán himself, did his
adherents lay down their arms. The happy issue of
the battle decided the victory of Christianity in
Hungary, and all that was still needed, was to
strengthen the new faith. The effects of this victory
were, nevertheless, of short duration, for in the year
1002, another anti-Christian movement broke out in
Transylvania, whose ruler, Duke Gyula, uniting with
the partly pagan, partly Mohammedan Petchenegs,
made an inroad into Hungary, carrying devastation
and bloodshed everywhere. Stephen now had to
march against this dangerous enemy, and not only
vanquished the Hungarian duke Gyula, but continued
his march into the country of the Petchenegs,
defeated their prince, Kaan, and looting his
camp got possession of all the rich treasures these
Petchenegs had carried away from the Greek empire.</p>

<p>The third and decidedly the most dangerous rising
took place in 1046, when a certain Vatha, a zealous
adherent of the former pagan religion, and an
offspring of Duke Gyula, availing himself of the disturbances
arising from the contest for the succession
to the throne, incited the people against the Christian
religion and its institutions. They urged Andrew,
the pretender to the throne of the country, “to abolish
the Christian religion and its institutions; to re-establish
the ancient religion and the laws brought
from Asia, and demanded that they should be
permitted to pull down the churches, and to drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
out the priests and the foreign immigrants.” Unaware
of the number and strength of the rebels the
prince did not venture to refuse their request. This
the rebels took for a tacit compliance, and, emboldened
by it, they fell, with wild rage, upon the Christians.
The Germans and Italians that were found
in the country, especially the bishops and priests,
were persecuted with most inhuman cruelty. The
churches and other places devoted to Christian
piety were destroyed, the ancient pagan religion
was restored, and everywhere the people resumed
the former mode of life according to their ancient
customs and heathen faith, offering up sacrifices, as
before, in woods and groves and near springs. During
these disorders St. Gerhard, the former tutor of
St. Emeric, and at that time bishop of Csanád, lost
his life. He was on his way to Pesth, to meet
Andrew, when he fell into the hands of the enraged
populace, was killed by them on the mountain opposite
Pesth, called Gellérthegy (Mount Gerhard) to
this day, and his body was thrown into the Danube.
Utterly dangerous as the symptoms of these risings
were, we see, however, how deeply even at that
time Christianity had taken root in Hungary. It
very soon became apparent that the revolution was
not only of a religious but of a political and social
character. King Andrew issued rigorous laws, menacing
every one who did not return to the Christian
religion and renounce the practice of heathenish
customs, with loss of life and property. The destroyed
churches were to be rebuilt, and the order
of things introduced by Stephen be respected again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
These laws and the punishments inflicted upon some
of the stubborn adherents of paganism did not fail
to produce their effect, and, in a short time, the
rebellion was crushed and order and quiet gradually
restored throughout the country.</p>

<p>And, strange to say, just as the Mohammedan Turks
of our day ascribe the decline and downfall of their
power to the many innovations introduced into their
religious and social life, and discover the main source
of their ruin in the assimilation to the West, precisely
so spoke and argued the Hungarians of that day.
They laid particular stress upon the fact that the
nation, whilst adhering to the religion and customs
of its ancestors, had been independent, strong, and
mighty, and had even made the whole of Europe
tremble; but that now, since it had adopted the
religion and customs of the West, the nation was
weakened by internal dissensions, strangers had become
her masters, foreign armies had penetrated into
the very heart of the country—nay, Hungary had lost
her independence and had become the vassal of a
foreign power. Such representations could not fail
to produce their effect. It was easy to convince the
uncultivated Hungarians, who were not yet confirmed
in the Christian religion and but ill brooked its
severe discipline, that all those troubles and misfortunes
which had visited the country were the consequences
of the introduction of Christianity, and that
to achieve a splendid future for the nation, in harmony
with its glorious past, this must be done upon
the ruins of Christianity and of the institutions introduced
by Stephen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>This great change, however repugnant it may have
seemed to the Hungarians, was, nevertheless, unavoidable.
As previously stated, the foreign elements
which flooded the country, owing to the very
large number of captives the Hungarians brought
with them from every part of Europe, had wrought
that change in the manners and habits of life in
spite of all the reluctance of the former Asiatic
nomads. These captives greatly outnumbering their
masters, were mostly used for agricultural purposes,
but their close contact with the ruling class unavoidably
produced a mitigation of the rude military
habits of the latter. The Hungarians eagerly listened
to the Christian chants and prayers of their
subjects. They imitated them in their food and dress,
and, although nearly two centuries had to pass before
the former wanderers on the Central-Asian
steppes could get accustomed to permanent habitations,
and, despite the aversion the proud warrior
felt to the plow, the ice, nevertheless, began to
break. The Asiatic mode of thinking had to be
given up, and with the tenets of Christian tradition
habits of Christian life were gradually introduced.</p>

<p>This process of transformation was greatly quickened
by the personal intercourse and family connections
of Duke Geyza and his chieftains with the
court and nobility of the neighboring countries.
Besides the involuntary immigration caused by the
forays, we meet with a remarkable influx of foreign
noblemen who, on the invitation of Duke Geyza,
settled in the country, towards the end of the tenth
century. The brothers Hunt and Pázmán came from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Suabia, Count Buzád from Meissen, Count Hermann
from Nuremberg; the Czech knights Radovan, Bogát,
and Lodán came with large retinues; many others
immigrated from Italy and Greece, so that the high
nobility of Hungary, already at the beginning of the
conversion of the Magyars, had a large infusion of
foreign blood. It may be added that the entire
clergy of that day was composed of Czechs, Germans,
and Italians. The ground was, therefore, duly
prepared, and it wanted only the iron hand of a resolute
and wise ruler to achieve the work of conversion,
and to accomplish the great task of transforming a
formerly warlike and nomadic nation into a Christian
and peaceful community. This ruler was King
Stephen I.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br /><br />

<small>ST. STEPHEN, THE FIRST KING OF HUNGARY.<br /><br />

997-1038.</small></h2>

<p>King Stephen led the Hungarian nation from
the darkness of paganism into the light of Christianity,
and from the disorders of barbarism into the
safer path of western civilization. He induced his
people to abandon the fierce independence of nomadic
life, and assigned to them a place in the disciplined
ranks of European society and of organized
states. Under him, and through his exertions, the
Hungarian people became a western nation. Never
was a change of such magnitude, and we may add
such a providential change, accomplished in so short
a time, with so little bloodshed, and with such signal
success as this remarkable transformation of the
Hungarian people. The contemporaries of this great
and noble man, those who assisted him in guiding
the destinies of the Hungarian nation, gave him
already full credit for the wise and patriotic course
pursued by him, and the Hungarian nation of the
present day still piously and gratefully cherishes his
memory. To the Hungarians of to-day, although
eight and a half centuries removed from St. Stephen,
his form continues to be a living one, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
they still fondly refer to his exalted example, his
acts, his opinions, and admonitions, as worthy to
inspire and admonish the young generations in their
country.</p>

<p>This need be no matter for surprise, for at no
period of Hungary’s history has her political continuity
been interrupted in such a way as to make her
lose sight of the noble source from which its greatness
sprang. No doubt a complete change has taken
place in the political and social order, in the course
of so many centuries, but the state structure, however
modified, still rests upon the deep and sure
foundations laid by the wisdom of her first king.
One day in the year, the 20th of August—called
St. Stephen’s day—is still hallowed to his memory.
On that day his embalmed right hand is carried
about with great pomp and solemnity, in a brilliant
procession, accompanied by religious ceremonies,
through ancient Buda, and shown to her populace.
The kingdom of Hungary is called the realm of St.
Stephen to this day, the Hungarian kings are still
crowned with the crown of St. Stephen, and the
nation acknowledges only him to be its king
whose temples have been touched by the sacred
crown. The Catholic Church in Hungary although
it no more occupies its former pre-eminent position
in the state, still retains enough of power, wealth,
and splendor to bear ample testimony to the lavish
liberality of St. Stephen. Thus the historian meets
everywhere with traces of his benignant activity, and
whilst the fame and saintliness of the great king
have surrounded his name with a luminous halo in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a><br /><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>the annals of his nation, that very brilliancy has prevented
from coming down to posterity such mere
terrestrial and every-day details as would assist in
drawing his portrait. The grand outlines of his
form detach themselves vividly and sharply from the
dark background of his age—but there is a lack of
contemporary accounts which would help to fill up
these outlines, and the legends of the succeeding
generations, which make mention of him, can but
ill supply this want, for they regard in him the
saint only, and not the man. His deeds alone remain
to guide us in the task of furnishing a truthful
picture of the founder of his country, and well may
we apply to him the words of Scripture, that the tree
shall be known by its fruit.</p>

<span class="caption">CORONATION OF ST. STEPHEN.</span></a></div>

<p>Stephen was born in Gran (Esztergom), the first
and most ancient capital of Hungary, about 969, at
a time when his father had not yet succeeded to the
exalted position of ruler over Hungary, and a magnificent
memorial chapel in the Roman style of the
tenth century, erected there, marks the event of his
birth in that place. His mother Sarolta, Geyza’s
first wife, was the daughter of that Gyula, Duke of
Transylvania, who, whilst upon a mission to Constantinople,
in 943, had embraced the Christian faith
and subsequently endeavored to spread it at home.
Thus a Christian mother watched prayerfully at the
cradle of young Stephen, and in early childhood,
already, the tender mind of the boy was guided by
the pious Count of San Severino. Adalbert, the
Archbishop of Prague, who sought a martyr’s death
and subsequently won the martyr’s crown, intro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>duced
him to the community of professing Christians.
With his wife Gisella, a Bavarian princess,
at his side, he took his place among the Western
rulers as their kinsman. While his long reign
proved him to be true to his country and his nation,
yet the paganism of the ancient Hungarians
was quite foreign to his soul.</p>

<p>After the first half of the tenth century religious
ideas began to exercise a more powerful influence
in Europe than before. The great movement which
originated in the monastery of Cluny, in France,
held out to the world the promise of a new salvation.
Men of extraordinary endowments began
again to proclaim with evangelical enthusiasm the
mortification of the flesh, in order to exalt the soul,
and the suppression of earthly desires for the purpose
of restoring the true faith to its pristine glory.
They insisted that the shepherd of the faithful
souls, the Church, should be freed from all earthly
fetters and interests, for, just as the soul was above
the body, so was the Church superior to the worldly
communities. The Church therefore, they taught,
must be raised from her humiliating position, her
former dependence changed into a state of the most
complete freedom. As a consequence, the visible
head of the Church, the Pope, could not be allowed
to remain the servant of the head of the
worldly power, the emperor, for it was the former
that Providence had entrusted with the care of the
destinies and happiness of humanity. These ideas
spread triumphantly and with incredible rapidity
throughout all Europe. They were heralded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
a sort of prophetic frenzy; and soul-stirring fanaticism
followed in their train. The age of asceticism,
long past and become an object almost of contempt,
was rescued from oblivion and revived. The
despised body was again subjected to tortures and
vexations, and the purified soul longed for the
destruction of its own earthly existence in order to
soar on high freed from mundane trammels. It was
the miraculous age of hermits, saints, and martyrs
who made it resound with their wailing and weeping,
changing this home of dust into a valley of
tears, so that the soul transported to the regions of
bliss might appear in greater splendor to the dazzled
eyes of the earthly beholder. The popes, moreover,
riding high on the unchained waves, guided the
Church through the tempest of the newly awakened
religious passions, with a watchful eye and
steady persistence toward one end—the exaltation
of the papal power over that of the emperors. At
the end of the tenth century Pope Sylvester II. was
the representative of the spirit of the age clamoring
for the aggrandizement of the papal power, and Otto
III. represented in opposition to him the imperial
power, undermined by the new ideas. Since the overthrow
of the Western Roman empire the world had
not been called upon to witness a contest of greater
import than the impending struggle between these
two rival powers. The great upheaval, indeed, which
was to shake Europe to its very centre, did not take
place until half a century later, but the seeds, from
which the war of ecclesiastical investiture, the stir
of the crusades, and the universality of the papal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
power were to spring, were already scattered throughout
the soil which had lain barren through many
centuries.</p>

<p>This was the age which gave birth to Stephen and
in which he was educated, but his exalted mind
rejected the exaggerations, eccentricities, and errors
of his time and accepted only its noble sentiments
and ideas. His sober-mindedness was equal to his
religious enthusiasm, and as his innate energy exceeded
both, he left it to religious visionaries to indulge
in ascetic dreams. He desired to be the apostle
of the promises of his faith, but not their martyr.
He made the maintenance, defence, and extension of
Christianity the task of his life, because he saw in its
establishment the only sure means for the safety and
happiness of his people. He pursued no schemes
looking to adventures in foreign lands, but devoted
all his thoughts, feelings, and energies to his own
nation, subordinating to her interests everybody and
every thing else. He defended these alike against
imperial attacks and papal encroachments. His eyes
were fixed on the Cross, but his strong right arm
rested on the hilt of his sword, and his apostolic zeal
never made him forget for a single moment his duty
to a people which had gone through many trials,
whose position amongst the European nations was
a very difficult one, whose destinies rested in his
hands, and who were yet to be called upon to play
a great part in the history of the world.</p>

<p>Stephen was about twenty-eight years old when he
succeeded his father in 997. He at once embarked
with the enthusiasm of youth, coupled with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
deliberation and constancy of manhood, on his mission
to bring to a happy conclusion the task begun
by his mother. In this work he was sedulously
assisted by Astrik and his monastic brethren, and
the gaze of the foreign Christian lords, who had
immigrated with his Bavarian wife, as well as of
the great number of lay and ecclesiastical persons
who came, flocking to the country, was centred
upon the young royal leader, who surpassed them all
in zeal and enthusiasm. He spared no pains, nor
was he deterred by dangers; he visited in person
the remotest parts of the realm, bringing light to
places where darkness prevailed, and imparting truth
where error stalked defiantly. He sought out the
men of distinction and the mighty of the land, and
the hearts which were closed to the message of the
foreign monks freely opened to his wise and friendly
exhortations. Where he could not prevail by the
charms of his apostolic persuasion he unhesitatingly
threw the weight of his royal sword into the scale.
Whilst battling with the arms of truth he did not recoil
from using violence, if necessary, in its service.
Fate did not spare him the cruel necessity of having
to proceed even against his own blood.</p>

<p>The more rapidly and successfully the work of
conversion went on, the greater became the apprehension
and exasperation of those who looked upon
the destruction of the ancient pagan faith as dangerous
and ruinous to their nation. Nor did these recoil
from any hazard to maintain their faith and to
prevent the national ruin anticipated by them. They
took up arms on more than one occasion, as has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
been previously mentioned, but Stephen succeeded
in quelling the dangerous rebellions. Assisted by
the foreign knights, he broke the power of paganism,
and he showed no regard for any pretence of
national aspirations. Those who still harbored the
ancient faith in their hearts kept it secretly locked
up there, and for the time being at least did homage
to the new faith and the power of the king. The
possessions of the rebels were devoted to ecclesiastical
uses, and the king, at the same time, bestirred
himself in the organization of the triumphant
Church. He divided the converted territory into
ecclesiastical districts, providing each with a spiritual
chief, and placing the ecclesiastical chief of Gran
at the head of all and of the Church government
instituted by him. He caused fortified places to
be erected throughout the newly organized Church
territory for the defence of Christianity, as well as
for the maintenance of his own worldly power, which
began nearly to rival that of the other Christian kings.</p>

<p>But in order successfully to carry into effect
these measures, Stephen had to obtain their confirmation
by at least one of the leading powers
which then shared in the mastery over Europe—namely,
imperialism and papacy. The emperors, on
the one hand, claimed supreme authority over all
the pagan populations converted to Christianity,
while the papal see, on the other hand, was inclined
to protect against the empire the smaller nations,
which were jealous of their independence, in
order to gain allies for the impending struggle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Church against the empire. Stephen was quick to
choose between these two. The German Church—except
in the abortive attempt made by Bishop Pilgrin—had
contributed but little to the conversion of
the Hungarian people, and it could therefore lay no
claim to exercise any authority over the Church of
Hungary. Nor had the German kings done any
thing to assist Geyza and Stephen in their attempts
at conversion. Stephen had before him the example
of his brother-in-law, Boleslas of Poland, who had but
recently applied to the papal see for the bestowal of
the royal crown, in order to secure the independence
of his position as a ruler and that of the Church in his
realm. The religious bent of Stephen’s mind, combined
with his acute perception of the true interests
of his country, induced him, at last, in the spring of
1000, to send a brilliant embassy to Rome, under the
lead of the faithful, experienced, and indefatigable
Astrik.</p>

<p>Pope Sylvester II., than whom no one exerted himself
more strenuously to increase the papal power,
received the Hungarian envoys cordially, and upon
learning from Astrik their mission, he exclaimed: “I
am but apostolic, but thy master who sent thee here
is, in truth, the apostle of Christ himself!” He
readily complied with Stephen’s every request, adding
even more signal favors. He confirmed the
bishoprics already established, and empowered him
to establish additional ones, conferring upon Stephen,
at the same time, such rights in the administration
of the affairs of the Church of Hungary as
hitherto had been allowed only to the most illustrious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
princes in Christendom, the sovereigns of France and
Germany. He granted to Stephen and his successors
the right of styling themselves “apostolic kings,” and to
have carried before them, on solemn occasions,
the double cross, as an emblem of their independent
ecclesiastical authority. As a further mark of
his favor, the Pope presented Stephen with the
crown which had been destined for Boleslas of Poland,
in order to symbolize for all times to come the
blessing bestowed upon the Hungarian kingdom by
God’s representative upon earth. The crown of to-day,
weighing altogether 136 ounces, is not quite
identical with the crown that adorned St. Stephen’s
head. It now consists of two parts. The upper
and more ancient part is the crown sent by Pope
Sylvester, the lower one has been added at a later
date. The former is formed by two intersecting
hoops and connected at the four lower ends by a
border. On its top is a small globe capped by a
cross, which is now in an inclined position, and beneath
it is seen a picture of the Saviour in sitting
posture, surrounded by the sun, the moon, and two
trees. The entire surface of the two hoops is adorned
with the figures of the twelve apostles, each having
an appropriate Latin inscription, but four of these
figures are covered by the lower crown. The lower
or newer crown is an open diadem from which project,
in front, representations of ruins, which terminate
in a crest alternating with semicircular bands.
The seams of the latter are covered with smaller-sized
pearls, and larger oval pearls adorn the crests.
Nine small drooping chains, laid out with precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
stones, are attached to the lower rim. A large sapphire
occupies the centre of the front of the diadem,
and above it, on a semicircular shield, is a representation
of the Saviour. To the left and right of the
sapphire are representations of the archangels, Michael
and Gabriel, and of the four saints, Damianus,
Dominic, Cosmus, and George, and, finally, of the
Greek emperors, Constantine Porphyrogenitus and
Michael Ducas, and of the Hungarian king Geyza,
with inscriptions. With regard to the upper crown
no doubt whatever is entertained as to its being the
one sent by Pope Sylvester, and concerning the lower
crown Hungarian historians state that it was
sent, about 1073, by the Greek emperor, Michael Ducas,
to the Hungarian duke, Geyza, as a mark of gratitude
for the good services rendered to him by the
latter. The exact date when the two crowns united
cannot be ascertained. This minute description of the
crown of Hungary may be well pardoned, considering
the antiquity and the high veneration in which this
relic of the past is held by the Hungarian people.</p>

<p>The legend of St. Stephen speaks thus of Astrik’s
mission to the Eternal City: “Father Astrik having
accomplished his errand in Rome, and obtained
even more than he had asked for, returned joyfully
home. As he was nearing Gran the king came out to
meet him with great pomp, and Father Astrik
showed him the presents he had brought with him
from Rome, the royal crown and the cross. Stephen
offered up thanks to God, and subsequently expressed
his gratitude to the Pope for the presents received.
The great prelates, the clergy, the lords, and the peo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>ple
having listened to the contents of the letter conveying
the apostolic benediction, with one heart and
soul and with shouts of joy acclaimed Stephen their
king, and having been anointed with the sacred oil,
he was crowned on the day of Mary’s ascension (15th
of August) at Gran.”</p>

<p>That highly important letter brought by Astrik
from Rome, which established the independent authority
of the Hungarian kings over the national
church, has been preserved to this day. The following
lines of the papal bull may in some measure
characterize the age in which they were written,
and illustrate, at the same time, the importance
which was ascribed to these missives during many
centuries:</p>

<p>“My glorious son,” the letter proceeds to say,
after having in the introduction exalted Stephen’s
apostolic zeal, “all that which thou hast desired of
the apostolic see, the crown, the royal title, the metropolitan
see at Gran, and the other bishoprics, we
joyfully allow and grant thee by the authority derived
from Almighty God and Saints Peter and Paul,
together with the apostolic and our own benediction.
The country which thou hast offered, together with
thy own self, to St. Peter, and the people of Hungary,
present and future, being henceforth received
under the protection of the Holy Roman Church, we
return them to thy wisdom, thy heirs, and rightful
successors, to possess, rule, and govern the same.
Thy heirs and successors, too, having been lawfully
elected by the magnates of the land, shall be likewise
bound to testify to ourselves and our successors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
their obedience and respect, to prove themselves
subjects of the Holy Roman Church, to steadfastly
adhere to, and support the religion of Christ our
Lord and Saviour. And as thy Highness did not
object to undertake the apostolic office of proclaiming
and spreading the faith of Christ, we feel moved
to confer, besides, upon thy Excellency and out of
regard for thy merits, upon thy heirs and lawful successors,
this especial privilege: we permit, desire,
and request that, as thou and thy successors will be
crowned with the crown we sent thee, the wearing
of the double cross may serve thee and them as an
apostolic token, even so that, according to the teachings
of God’s mercy, thou and they may direct and
order, in our and our successors’ place and stead, the
present and future churches of thy realm. * * *
We also beseech Almighty God that thou mayest
rule and wear the crown, and that He shall cause
the fruits of His truth to grow and increase; that
He may abundantly water with the dew of His
blessing the new plants of thy realm; that He
may preserve unimpaired thy country for thee,
and thee for thy country; that He may protect
thee against thy open and secret foes, and adorn
thee, after the vexations of thy earthly rule, with
the eternal crown in His heavenly kingdom.”</p>

<p>The brilliant successes so rapidly achieved by
Stephen during the first years of his reign secured
the triumph of Christianity and of the royal
authority in the western half of the country only.
The adherents of the ancient faith and liberty still
remained in a majority in the eastern, more-thinly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
peopled regions beyond the Theiss and in Transylvania.
Gyula, the duke of Transylvania, and the uncle
of Stephen, was not slow in protesting against the
new kingdom and the innovations coupled with it.
The rebellion failed, as we have already seen. Gyula
and his whole family were made captives by the victors,
and neither he nor his posterity ever regained
their lost power. Transylvania was more closely
united with the mother country, and from that time,
during a period extending over more than five centuries,
was ruled by <i>vayvodes</i> appointed by the kings.
Soon after Stephen opposed victoriously the Petchenegs,
the allies of the defeated Gyula, who were settled
beyond the Transylvanian mountains in the country
known at present as Roumania, and having also
defeated Akhtum, who, trusting in the protection of
the Greek emperor, was disposed to act the master
in the region enclosed by the Danube, Theiss, and
Maros, there was no one in the whole land who—openly,
at least—dared to refuse homage to the
crown pressing the temples of Stephen and to the
double cross. During the twenty years succeeding
the events just narrated, history is entirely silent as
to any great martial enterprise of Stephen. It is
true that hostilities were frequent along the northern
and western borders against the Poles and Czechs,
but they were never of a character to endanger the
territorial integrity of the country. During those
years of comparative peace Stephen firmly established
the Hungarian Christian kingdom.</p>

<p>The Christian Church was the corner-stone of all
social and political order in the days of Stephen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
The Church pointed out the principal objects of
human endeavor, marked out the ways leading to
the accomplishment of those aims, drew the bounds
of the liberty of action, and prescribed to mankind
its duties. It educated, instructed, and disciplined the
people in the name and in the place of the state, and
in doing this the Church acted for the benefit of the
state. Hence it was that Stephen, in organizing the
Hungarian Christian Church and placing it on a firmer
basis, consulted quite as much the interests of his
royal power as the promptings of his apostolic zeal.
Where the Christian faith gained ground, there the
respect for royalty also took root, and the first care
of royalty, when its authority had become powerful,
was to preserve the authority of the Church.</p>

<p>Immediately on his accession to the throne,
Stephen addressed himself to the great and arduous
task, and in all places where the promises of the
holy faith, scattered by his proselyting zeal, met
with a grateful soil, he established the earliest religious
communities. Later, as the number of parishes
rapidly increased, he appointed chief prelates
to superintend and maintain the flocks and to keep
them together. The ecclesiastical dignities and offices
were conferred, in the beginning, without exception,
upon members of the religious orders, they
being at that time the most faithful warriors of Christianity
against paganism, and the most devoted servants
of the triumphant church. Stephen took good
care of them, and rewarded them according to their
merits. He founded four abbeys for these pious
monks, who all of them belonged to the religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
order of St. Benedict. The abbey of Pannonhalom
was the wealthiest and most distinguished among
these; and to this day, it maintains the chief rank
among the greatly increased number of kindred societies.
The first schools were connected with the
cathedrals and monasteries, and although their mission
consisted mainly in propagating the new church
and faith, they yet cultivated the scanty learning of
the age.</p>

<p>Stephen endowed the bishoprics and monasteries
with a generosity truly royal. He granted them
large possessions in land, together with numerous
bondsmen inhabiting the estates. The Hungarian
Catholic Church has preserved the larger part of
these grants to this day. His munificence was displayed
in the cathedral at Stuhlweissenburg (Székesfejérvár),
built in honor of the Virgin Mary, of
whose marvels of enchantment the old chronicles
speak with reverential awe. The chronicler calls it
“the magnificent church famous for its wondrous
workmanship, the walls of which are adorned with
beautiful carvings, and whose floor is inlaid with
marble slabs,” and then he proceeds in this strain:
“Those can bear witness to the truth of my words
who have beheld there with their own eyes the
numerous chasubles, sacred utensils, and other ornaments,
the many exquisite tablets wrought of pure
gold and inlaid with the most precious jewels about
the altars, the chalice of admirable workmanship
standing on Christ’s table, and the various vessels of
crystal, onyx, gold, and silver with which the sacristy
was crowded.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>Stephen’s munificence was not confined to his own
realm, and numerous memorials of his beneficence
and generosity are still preserved in foreign lands.
As soon as Christianity had gained a firm foothold
in the land, and the Hungarian people felt no more
as strangers in the family of Christian nations, the
natives, either singly or in larger numbers, began to
journey to the revered cities of Rome, Constantinople,
and Jerusalem. Stephen took care that these
pilgrims should feel at home in the strange places
they visited. Thus, amongst other things, he had a
church and dwelling-house built in Rome for the
accommodation of twelve canons, providing it also
with a <i>hospitium</i> (inn). In Constantinople and Jerusalem
also he caused a convent and church to be
erected, within whose hospitable walls the Hungarian
pilgrim might find rest for his weary body, after the
fatigues of the long journey, and spiritual comfort
for his thirsting soul. He was ever mindful of the interests
of Christianity both at home and abroad. He
not only founded the Hungarian Christian Church,
but knew how to make it universally respected, and,
in his own time already, the popes were in the habit
of referring to Hungary as the “archiregnum”—that
is, a country superior to the others.</p>

<p>In establishing the Hungarian kingdom Stephen
necessarily shaped its institutions after the pattern
of the Western States, but fortunately for the nation
he possessed a rare discrimination which made him
imitate his neighbors in those things only which
were beneficial or unavoidable, whilst he rejected
their errors and refused to introduce them into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
own land. At that period feudalism, although it had
sadly degenerated, prevailed, England alone excepted,
throughout the whole West. It was a system
which did not permit the strengthening of the
central power of the state, and the countries subjected
to it were divided up into parts but loosely
connected, each of which acknowledged an almost
independent master, who, although he held his county
or duchy from his king, and owned and governed it
by virtue of that tenure, was yet powerful enough to
defy with impunity the sovereign himself. Without
adverting to the pitiful dismemberment of Italy, we
need only mention that France was divided into
about fifty, and Germany into five small principalities
of this character. The kings themselves might
make use of their kingly title, they might bask in
the splendor of their own royalty, but of the plenitude
of their royal power they could but rarely and
then only temporarily boast.</p>

<p>Stephen’s chief aim was to enhance the royal power
by rendering it as independent as he possibly could
of restrictions on the part of the nation, and to introduce
such institutions as would prove most efficacious
in the defence of the integrity and unity of nation and
country. He left the nobility—the descendants of
those who had taken possession of the soil at the
conquest of Hungary—in the undisturbed enjoyment
of their ancient privileges; he did not restrict
their rights, but in turn did not allow himself to be
hampered by them. He only introduced an innovation
with reference to the tenure of their property,
which he changed from tribal to individual posses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>sion,
using his royal authority to protect each man
in the possession of the estates thus allotted to him.
The nobles governed themselves, administered justice
amongst themselves, through men of their own selection,
and the king interfered only if he was especially
requested to judge between them. The nobles had
always free access to the king’s person, not only during
Stephen’s reign, but for many centuries afterwards.
The nobility was exempted from the payment
of any kind of taxes into the royal treasury, and
they joined the king’s army only if the country was
menaced by a foreign foe, or if they chose to offer
their services of their own free will.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the great power of the nobility had
its foundations on freehold possessions in land, Stephen
was careful to support the dignity of the royal
power by the control of large domains. The royal
family were already the owners of private estates of
large extent, and to these the king now added those
vast tracts of land which, scattered throughout the
whole realm, and more particularly extending along
the frontiers, were without masters, and could not
well pass into private hands, as the scant Hungarian
population was inadequate for their occupation.
These domains, which, for the most part, were
thinly inhabited by the indigenous conquered populations,
speaking their own languages, and the colonization
of which by foreigners became a special
object with the kings, were now declared state property,
and as such taken possession of and administered
by Stephen. He divided these possessions
into small domains, called in Latin <i>comitatus</i>, coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>ty,
and in Hungarian <i>megye</i>, eyre or circuit, and placed
at the head of the administration of each county a
royal official styled <i>comes</i>, count. These districts subsequently
gave rise to the county system, which was
destined to play such an important part in the history
of the country, but originally they were designed to
answer a twofold purpose, one financial and one military.
One portion of the people living on these
royal lands had to hand over to the royal treasury
a certain part of their produce, whilst another portion
was bound to military service for life. In
this way the royal counties furnished a sort of
standing army, always at the disposal of the king,
and supplied, at the same time, the revenues necessary
to support that army. Stephen found also other
means to replenish his treasury and to add to his military
strength. The revenues derived from the mineral
and salt mines, and from the coining of money,
flowed into the royal coffers; he levied, besides, a
thirtieth on all merchandise, market-tolls at fairs,
and collected tolls on the roads, and at bridges
and ferries. The towns and the privileged territories
had to pay taxes, and, on a given day, to
send presents to the king. Stephen added, besides,
to his military strength by granting to individuals—mostly
to native or foreign noblemen of reduced
circumstances—extensive estates in fee, subject to
the obligation, in case of need, of joining the royal
army with a fixed number of armed men. The
Petchenegs, Szeklers, and Ruthenes settled as border
guards along the frontiers were also obliged to render
military service, and even the royal cities sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
their contingents of troops equipped by them. This
brief enumeration of the means employed by Stephen
to strengthen his throne, will make it evident that he
provided abundant resources for maintaining the royal
power, such as none of his neighbors, or even the
rulers of the countries further west, had, then, at
their disposal.</p>

<p>The royal court was the centre and faithful mirror
of that kingly power, and, in its ordering and conduct,
Stephen was careful to imitate foreign courts,
not only in their main features, but at times even in
their most minute details. The court of his imperial
brother-in-law, Henry II. of Germany, especially,
served him as a model. Thus it was held that the
person of the king was sacred, and that to offend
against him who was the embodiment of the majesty
of the state, was looked upon as a crime to be punished
with loss of life and fortune. The king stood
above all the living, and above the law itself. Stephen
surrounded himself with the distinguished men,
lay and ecclesiastical, of the realm, and, aided by their
counsel, administered the affairs of the country, but
his word and will was a law to everybody. Amongst
the officers of his court were a lord-palatine, a court-judge,
a lord of the treasury, and many others, who,
in part, assisted him in the government of the state
and, in part, ministered to the comforts of the court.
At a much later period only, after the lapse of centuries,
did the offices of palatine, judge, and treasurer,
become dignities of the realm.</p>

<p>The government of the country in time of peace
involved no great care or trouble, for only the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
domains or counties and the royal cities possessing
privileges fell within the sphere of the direct power
of the king and court. The Church and nobility
governed themselves and applied to the king in
cases of appeal only, the royal towns conducted
their affairs through the agency of judges and chief
magistrates elected by themselves, whilst the bulk of
the people, composed of the various classes of bondmen
and servants, were completely subjected to the
authority and jurisdiction of the lords of the land.
The bondman might move about freely, but he could
never emancipate himself from the tutelage of the
landlords. The Hungarian nation was composed of
the same social strata which were to be met with
everywhere in the West, and the growth of these
pursued the same direction, differing, however, in
one particular—the relation of the large landed
proprietors, the nobility, to their king. To these
exceptional relations must be attributed the fact
that the political changes in the country did not
run in parallel grooves with those of the other
western states. Stephen granted no constitution,
all complete, to his people; its growth was the
work of centuries, but the country was indebted to
him for having organized the state in such a manner
that, whilst there was nothing in the way of a
free and healthy development of its political institutions,
its inherent strength was such that it could
successfully resist the many and severe shocks to
which in the course of nearly a thousand years it
was subjected.</p>

<p>The country prospered during the long reign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
King Stephen, thanks to his untiring labors and to
the rare moderation with which he tempered his passionate
zeal. The nation became gradually familiar
with the changes wrought, and began to accept the
new order of things, although it could not quite forget
the old ways. Old memories revived again and
again, and those especially who bowed down before
the crown and cross from compulsion and not from
conviction, were filled with anxiety as to the uncertain
future. Stephen thoroughly understood the
feelings and prejudices of his people, and he carefully
avoided every act, and steered clear of every
complication which might tend to rouse their passions.
He well knew that time alone could give
permanence and stability to the institutions created
by him, and that years of peace and continued exertions
were necessary to consolidate his work. Two
great objects, therefore, occupied his mind continually,
even in his old age; in the first place, to
defend the realm against external dangers, and in
the second place, to raise a successor to himself to
whom he might safely entrust the continuation of
the work commenced by him.</p>

<p>But fate denied him the accomplishment of either
of his objects. As long as Henry II., his brother-in-law,
reigned there was peace between Hungary
and the German empire, but the death of the latter
in 1024 severed the bond of amity between the two
countries. The feelings entertained by Conrad II.
toward the kingdom of Hungary were very different
from those manifested by his predecessor, and this
change of sentiment was soon shown by Conrad’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
laying claim, by virtue of his imperial prerogative,
to the sovereignty over Stephen’s realm. Conrad,
with his ally, the Duke of Bohemia, and the united
forces of his vast empire, began war in 1030, and
overran with his armies the country on both banks
of the Danube, as far as the Gran and the Raab.
Stephen was undismayed, his courage rather rose
with the perils environing him. He bade the people
throughout the land to fast and pray, for not alone
his kingdom was at stake, but the independence of
the Hungarian Church was menaced by the imperial
forces. Those who looked with indifference at the
cause of the Hungarian crown and the cross, had
their enthusiasm excited by the proud satisfaction
of fighting in defence of the national dignity and
liberty. Amongst those western nations who had
been for so long a time harassed by the military expeditions
of the Hungarians, the German people,
feeling its strength, was the first to turn its arms
against the former assailants. But Conrad’s attack
proved unsuccessful against the united strength of
the king and the nation, between whom the peril
from without had restored full harmony, and he was
compelled to leave the country in the autumn of the
very year in which he entered upon the war, dejectedly
returning to Germany after a campaign of
utter failure instead of the expected triumphs.
Peace was concluded in the following year, and the
emperor acknowledged the independence of the
young but powerful kingdom. Conrad’s son, who
subsequently succeeded to the imperial throne as
Henry III., visited Stephen at his court, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
draw closer the ties of amity between the two countries.
The danger had passed for the time being,
but the apprehensions of Stephen were far from
being allayed as he pondered on the future. The
peace just concluded did not satisfy him; there
were no guaranties for its preservation, nor had he
any faith in its being a permanent peace, for he well
knew that the German kings, as long as they wore
the imperial crown, would not fail to repeat their
attacks on the independence of the young kingdom.
Reflections of this sombre nature often filled his
soul with despondency, and then came occasions
when he entertained fears that the nation might not
be strong enough to withstand the dangers threatening
her, or that if she triumphed she would, in the
intoxication of her victory, turn with exasperation
against those innovations which had brought the
foreign foes upon her.</p>

<p>All his hopes centred in Duke Emeric, his only
son, who, under the care of the pious Bishop Gerhard,
grew up to be a fine youth, full of promise,
in whom his fond father discovered all those qualities
which he wished him to possess for the good
of his nation. The young prince was, indeed, very
zealous in his faith; his piety amounted almost
to frenzy, and he turned away from the world,
despising its joys and harassing struggles, and seeking
the salvation of his soul in self-denial and the
mortification of his flesh. He was, in truth, the holy
child of a holy parent, but not born to rule as the
fit son of a great king. He preferred the cloister to
the royal throne, and, far from inheriting the apos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>tolic
virtues of his august father, he was rather inclined
to indulge in the errors of the age he lived in.
But the aged king, dazzled by the lustre of his son’s
holiness, was blind to his shortcomings. He had
faith in him, for in him he saw his only hope. In
order fitly to prepare him for his future royal mission,
he set down for him in writing the experiences
of his long and beneficent rule, and the wisdom and
goodness treasured up in his heart and mind. These
admonitions addressed to his son have been spared
by all-devouring time, and to this day they are apt
to delight and instruct us as one of the most precious
relics of that age. The reader will surely be pleased
with a few specimens of these exhortations:</p>

<p>“I cannot refrain, my beloved son,” Stephen wrote,
“from giving thee advice, instruction, and commands
whereby to guide thyself and thy subjects. * * *
Strive to obey sedulously the injunctions of thy
father, for if thou despisest these thou lovest neither
God nor man. Be therefore dutiful, my son; thou
hast been brought up amidst delights and treasures,
and knowest nothing of the arduous labors of war
and the perils of hostile invasions by foreign nations,
in the midst of which nearly my whole life has been
passed. The time has arrived to leave behind thee
those pillows of luxuriousness which are apt to render
thee weak and frivolous, to make thee waste thy
virtues, and to nourish in thee thy sins. Harden thy
soul in order that thy mind may attentively listen to
my counsels.”</p>

<p>After enlarging in ten paragraphs upon the topic
of his counsels, he proceeds as follows: “I command,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
counsel, and advise thee, above all, to preserve carefully
the apostolic and Catholic faith if thou wishest
thy kingly crown to be held in respect, and to set
such an example to thy subjects that the clergy
may justly call thee a Christian man, * * * for
he who does not adorn his faith with good deeds—the
one being a dead thing without the others—cannot
rule in honor.”</p>

<p>Stephen then lays down rules of conduct towards
the magnates of the realm, the lay lords, the high
dignitaries, and the warriors, as follows: “They are,
my dear son, thy fathers and thy brothers, neither
call them nor make them thy servents. Let them
combat for thee, but not serve thee. Rule over
them peaceably, humbly, and gently, without anger,
pride, and envy, bearing in mind that all men are
equal, that nothing exalts more than humility, nor
is there any thing more degrading than pride and
envy. If thou wilt be peaceable, every one will love
thee and call thee a brave king, but if thou wilt be
irritable, overbearing, and envious, and look down
upon the lords, the might of the warriors will weaken
thy kingly state, and thou wilt lose thy realm.
Govern them with thy virtues, so that, inspired by
love for thee, they may adhere to thy royal dignity.”</p>

<p>He then recommends, above all, patience and careful
inquiry in the administration of justice in these
words: “Whenever a capital cause or other cause of
great importance be brought before thee for judgment,
be not impatient, nor indulge in oaths beforehand
that the accused shall be brought to punishment.
Do not hasten to pronounce judgment thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>self,
lest thy royal dignity be impaired thereby, but
leave the cause rather in the hands of the regular
judges. Fear the functions of a judge, and even the
name of a judge, and rather rejoice in being and
having the name of a righteous king. Patient kings
rule, impatient ones oppress. If, however, there be
a cause which it is fit for thee to decide, judge mercifully
and patiently to the enhancement of the praise
and glory of thy crown.”</p>

<p>Speaking of the foreigners settled in the country,
he says: “The Roman empire owed its growth, and
its rulers their glory and power, chiefly to the numerous
wise and noble men who gathered within its
boundaries from every quarter of the world. * * *
Foreigners coming from different countries and
places to settle here bring with them a variety of
languages, customs, instructive matters, and arms,
which all contribute to adorn and glorify the royal
court, holding in check, at the same time, foreign
powers. A country speaking but one language, and
where uniform customs prevail, is weak and frail.
Therefore I enjoin on thee, my son, to treat and behave
towards them decorously, so that they shall
more cheerfully abide with thee than elsewhere. For
if thou shouldst spoil what I have built up, and scatter
what I have gathered, thy realm would surely
suffer great detriment from it.”</p>

<p>The preference of Stephen for the immigrants
from abroad did not degenerate into contempt for
ancient customs, for he thus concludes: “It is both
glorious and royal to respect the laws of the forefathers
and to imitate ancestors worthy of reverence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
He who holds in contempt the decisions of his predecessors
will not keep the laws of God. Conform,
therefore, my dear son, to my institutions, and follow
without hesitation my customs, which befit the
royal dignity. It would be difficult for thee to
govern a realm of this character without following
the precedents laid down by those who governed
before thee. Adhere, therefore, to my customs, so
that thou shalt be deemed the first amongst thine,
and merit the praise of the stranger. * * * The
evil-minded ruler who stains himself with cruelty
vainly calls himself king; he but deserves the name
of a tyrant. I therefore beseech and enjoin upon
thee, my beloved son, thou delight of my heart and
hope of the coming generation, be, above all, gracious,
not only to thy kinsmen, to princes, and to
dukes, but also to thy neighbors and subjects; be
merciful and forbearing not only to the powerful
but to the weak; and, finally, be strong, lest good
fortune elate thee, and bad fortune depress thee. Be
humble, moderate, and gentle, be honorable and
modest, for these virtues are the chief ornaments of
the kingly crown.”</p>

<p>But the young duke was not fated to realize the
hopes of his fond father. In the very year (1031),
and on the very day, say the chronicles, on which
Stephen intended to have his son annointed before
the nation as his successor, the mysterious edict
of divine Providence suddenly took him away. In
place of the crown of terrestrial power, his unstained
life, nipped in the bud, was to be rewarded by the
glory of everlasting salvation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>This sad blow prostrated the aged king, who had
already been ailing, throwing him on his bed, and
from that moment up to the day of his death he was
unable to recover either his bodily or mental
strength. Bereft of all hope and left to himself
with his great sorrow and harassing doubts, he
looked about him irresolutely for one on whose
shoulders the cares of royalty should rest after his
departure. The descendants of his uncle Michael
were still living, and his choice fell upon them, they
being rightfully entitled to succeed to the throne.
But he was foiled in his intention by the opposition
of the court, where the foreigners rallying round
Queen Gisella had obtained the mastery, and where
they now resorted to every evil scheme to compel
the decrepit king to designate as his successor Duke
Peter, who resided at the court, and was the son of one
of the king’s sisters, and Ottone Urseolo, the Doge
of Venice. He finally yielded, and by this act the
vessel of State which he had piloted for nearly half
a century with a strong arm and great circumspection,
was drawn into a most dangerous current.
Stephen was the founder of the kingdom of Hungary;
to others was left the inheritance of defending
and strengthening it. He died in 1038 on Mary’s
Ascension Day, the anniversary of the same day on
which, thirty-eight years before, he had placed the
crown on his head. On the day of his death Stephen
gathered about him his courtiers and the magnates
of the land, and commended the realm to
their care, but, as if distrustful of them, he, in his
last prayer, placed both the church and the kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
founded by him under the patronage of the Holy
Virgin Mary. Five centuries later Stephen was
canonized and placed upon the calendar of saints by
the Church of Rome, and the event of the exaltation
of their first king and apostle was celebrated as a
great national holiday by the people. Time has
preserved St. Stephen’s right hand and the crown
which his piety earned for him, but the brightest and
noblest monument he erected to himself is the creation
of a commonwealth whose free institutions, unimpaired
strength and independence have survived
the storms of nearly nine centuries.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br /><br />

<small>THE KINGS OF THE HOUSE OF ÁRPÁD.</small></h2>

<p>The crown of St. Stephen remained in the dynastic
family of Árpád for three centuries. The kings
of this dynasty erected, upon the foundations laid by
the first great king of that house, the proud and enduring
structure of the Hungarian Church and State.
The liberty of the nation and the independence of the
country were maintained by these rulers against the
ever-recurring attacks of both the Eastern and Western
empires, and the paternal meddling of the popes,
as well as against the barbarians invading Europe
from the East, whose devastations menaced the
complete destruction of every thing that lay in their
path.</p>

<p>But while they repulsed with an ever-ready and
strong arm all hostile attacks—from whatever quarter
they might come—they willingly extended the right
hand of friendship and hospitality to those who came
to settle in the country with peaceful intentions, and
brought with them the valued seeds of Western culture.
The Hungarians themselves could be but with
difficulty weaned from their ancient customs, and
they still continued to be the martial element of
the country, inured to war and laying down their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
lives on fields of battle; but the populations which
had emigrated from the West, protected by royal
immunities, were the fathers of a busy and prosperous
city-life, and laid the foundations of civilization
in Hungary. A few monumental memorials,
spared by the hand of time, proclaim to this day
the artistic taste and wealth of those remote centuries,
and the scant words to be found in ancient
and decayed parchments speak loudly, and with no
uncertain sound, of the cities of that time as busy
marts of industrial activity and thriving commerce.
From the list of the annual revenues of one of the
Árpáds, Béla III., and those of the country in the
twelfth century, which was submitted by him when
asking for the hand of the daughter of the French
king, the civilized West learned with amazement of
the enormous wealth of the king ruling near the
eastern confines of the Western world. The king’s
wealth was but a reflex of the prosperity of the people.
During the era of the Árpáds Hungary surpassed
many a Western country in power and wealth,
and in the work of civilization either kept pace with
them or faithfully followed in their footsteps. These
three hundred years produced great kings, who, distinguished
by their abilities, character, and achievements,
made the country strong and flourishing;
but this era produced also weak and frivolous
rulers, whose faults will forever darken their memory.
Posterity, however, cherishes the memory of all with
equal piety, and is accustomed to look at the entire
period in the light of the lustre of the great kings
only. No wonder, therefore, if the ancient chron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>iclers,
in describing the events of that era, are led by
their piety to weave into the text gorgeous tales and
legends for the purpose of enhancing the glory of
the great kings, and of palliating the shortcomings
of those kings who were weak and frail.</p>

<p>The history of those three centuries may be divided
into three periods. The first, comprising the first
two centuries, may be called the heroic period of
the young kingdom, in the course of which both the
foreign and domestic foes were triumphantly resisted,
the attacks of the neighboring nations repulsed,
and the risings of paganism quelled. The
second comprises the early part of the thirteenth
century. During this period the royal power entered
upon a state of decay, and was no longer able either
to secure respect for the law or the execution of its
behests. At this time too the nobility extorted
from royalty a charter called the Golden Bull, confirming
their immunities. During the third period
an oligarchy, recruited from the ranks of the nobility,
rose to power, and became the scourge of the nation,
defying the royal authority and trampling upon all
law. The licentiousness of this class ruined the
country, which was then very near becoming a prey
of the Mongols, who made an unexpected invasion.
The realm, however, was saved from utter destruction
by the devotion of one of her great kings and
a happy conjuncture of circumstances.</p>

<p>The misgivings which filled Stephen’s soul when
he closed his eyes in eternal sleep soon proved to
have been well founded. Four years had hardly
elapsed after his death when the armies of the Ger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>man
emperor were already marching on Hungary,
and in another four years paganism arose in a formidable
rebellion, with the avowed purpose of destroying
the new church and kingdom.</p>

<p>Peter (1038-1046), Stephen’s successor, who was
of foreign descent and of a proud and frivolous nature,
despised the rude and uncivilized Hungarians.
He surrounded himself with foreigners, German and
Italian immigrants, who divided amongst themselves
the chief dignities of the State, preyed upon the
prosperity of the country, and ruined the morals of
the people. The nation did not tolerate his misrule
very long. The fierce hatred and exasperation with
which they looked at every thing foreign found its
vent against Peter, whom they drove from the country
and then elected in his place one of their own nation,
Samuel Aba (1041-1044), the late king’s brother-in-law.
Peter did not renounce his lost power, but
asked the help of the German emperor, which he
readily obtained. The Emperor Henry III. opened
with his German troops the way to the forfeited
throne, and Samuel Aba, who marched against him,
having fallen on the battle-field, Peter for the second
time had the crown of St. Stephen placed on his
brow, but this time he took the oath of fealty to the
German emperor. Thus did Hungary for the moment
become a vassal state of the German empire.
But the vassalage was short, for hardly had the emperor
withdrawn from the country when the passionate
wrath of the nation rose higher than ever against
Peter. This time, however, the wrath was not alone
against his person, but menaced destruction to every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a><br /><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>thing opposed to the ancient order of things, and produced
a bitter contest against both Christianity and
the royal dignity. Peter would have fain escaped now
from his persecutors, but he was captured, thrown
into prison, and deprived of his sight, and then, from
the depth of his misery, he vainly bewailed the giddiness
which had conjured up the storm of passions
that had deprived him of his throne, his eyesight,
and liberty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="i122" id="i122">
<img src="images/i_122.png" width="500" height="314" alt="THE PEOPLE, SEDUCED BY VATHA." />
<span class="caption">THE PEOPLE, SEDUCED BY VATHA, CLAIM THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF PAGANISM.</span></a></div>

<p>The leader of the pagan rebellion was Vatha. At
his command firebrands were thrown into the
churches and monasteries, the crosses were demolished,
and every thing proclaiming the new faith was
reduced to ruins; and by his advice ambassadors
were sent to the dukes of the house of Árpád, who,
after Stephen’s death, had sought refuge in foreign
countries, to summon them to return to the country
and restore there the old order. King Andrew I.
(1046-1061), to whom the supreme power had been
offered, and who, during his exile in Russia, had
married the daughter of the Prince of Kiev, immediately
obeyed the summons, not, however to submit
to the behests of paganism, but to rule in accordance
with the principles and in the spirit of his illustrious
kinsman, King Stephen. For a while, indeed, he
was compelled to bear with the outbreaks, massacres,
and devastations of paganism, but as soon as he felt
secure in his new power, and especially after having
taken up his residence in Stuhlweissenburg, then the
capital of the country, where he was able to collect
around him the Christian inhabitants of the West,
who lived there in large numbers, he at once turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
his arms against the pagan rebels. He dispersed
their armies, captured their leaders, and crushed
the rebellion with merciless severity.</p>

<p>The double cross shone out again triumphantly, but
the crown was still menaced by danger. After the defeat
of paganism the Emperor Henry III. sent envoys
to Andrew, asking satisfaction for the cruelties inflicted
upon Peter and calling upon the king to renew
the oath of fealty to the emperor of Germany. Andrew
felt that unless he maintained the independence
of the country, and the dignity of the crown, he incurred
the risk of losing the throne itself. He therefore
rejected Henry’s claims and prepared for the defence
of the country. At the same time he summoned
home his brother Béla (Adalbert) who, during his
exile in Poland, had won high distinction as a
soldier, and had obtained, as a reward for his military
services, the hand of a daughter of Miecislas.
Andrew himself was in ill-health, and he did not
care to face the brewing storm single-handed. He
wanted to have at his side the powerful arm of his
brave and mighty brother, whose very appearance
was sufficient to inspire the distressed nation with
confidence and hope. He gave Béla one third of
the realm, and, being childless, promised him the
crown after his decease. Neither Andrew nor the
nation were disappointed in Duke Béla, who was
believed by the people to be irresistible. It was in
vain that Henry III. collected the entire armed
force of the empire, and three times in succession
(1049-1052) threw this force upon Hungary. In
each campaign Duke Béla succeeded in dealing deadly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
blows upon the invaders. His triumph was so complete
that the emperor was compelled to solemnly
proclaim peace, again acknowledging the independence
of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The nation was not permitted long to enjoy the
peace following her almost miraculous escape. Domestic
dissensions took the place of the dangers
threatening from abroad, and this time the feuds
did not originate with the people, but with the
royal family itself. All the glory of the important
results of the German wars, of the driving the enemy
from the country, and of her happy escape from the
besetting dangers, centred in the person of Duke
Béla. The nation looked with love and admiration
upon the knightly form of their favorite, and his
popularity was so great that it quite overshadowed
that of Andrew, notwithstanding all his kingly power.
Andrew’s feelings were deeply hurt by the popularity
of his brother, nor could he help being terrified by
it. But it was not his brother’s popularity alone
which troubled him. During the war a son had
been born to Andrew, who was christened Solomon.
Andrew now repented of his promise to Béla. He
wished his infant son to succeed to the throne, and
in order to insure it to him, he caused Solomon to
be crowned in spite of his tender age. Not satisfied
with this, but fearing that Béla, aggrieved by these
proceedings, might rise against Solomon at some
future time, he betrothed his little son to the
daughter of the recently humbled emperor, in order
to secure for Solomon the powerful aid of the German
empire against Béla’s attacks. Every move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>ment
of Andrew was dictated by fear, and he saw
cause for trembling in every thing. What troubled
him most was that Béla had never breathed a word
about his griefs or wrongs. Andrew would often
ask himself whether Béla was candid in his apparent
indifference, or whether, under the cover of this calm
repose, he was not concocting dangerous schemes
against him and young Solomon. He determined to
put Béla’s candor to the proof. He had been ailing,
and made his feeble condition a pretext for inviting
his brother to the court. He received Béla with
kindly words, confided to him his misgivings, appealed
to his generosity, and repeatedly assured him
that he did not intend to defraud him of his rights
by the acts done in favor of his son Solomon. Andrew
concluded by saying that he left it to Béla to
decide whether he would rather succeed to the
throne after his own death, or be satisfied to remain
at the side of young Solomon as the military chief
of the nation and the protector of the realm. The
old chronicles relate that Andrew, having finished
his sweet speech, caused to be placed before Béla
the royal crown and a sword, calling upon him to
choose between the two. “I take the sword,” exclaimed
Béla, unable to conceal his indignation,
“for if I coveted the crown, I could always obtain
it with the sword.”</p>

<p>The feud between the two brothers became henceforth
irreconcilable. The nation sided with Béla.
The emperor spoken of before was dead, and a boy
occupied the German throne. Andrew had sent his
queen and young son some time before to the Ger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>man
court, and now he marched against Béla, who
was prepared to meet him. The two brothers confronted
each other near the Theiss, and Andrew lost
both the battle and his life, whilst Béla was on the
field of battle proclaimed king of the realm.</p>

<p>Béla and his family occupy a conspicuous place in
the history of the first century of the Hungarian
kingdom. He himself, two of his sons, and one of
his grandsons were destined to successfully defend
the country, to pacify the nation, and, pursuing the
work of Stephen, to complete the creations of that
great king. They were all endowed with eminent
qualities befitting the great task allotted to them.
The heroism, devotion, and wisdom of the father
descended to the children, in whose character the
inherited virtues shone out with even a brighter and
purer light. They were zealous guardians of their
kingdom and devout Christians, and they were
wedded, heart and soul, to their nation, which
beheld in its kings with feelings of delight the embodiment
of its own best qualities. The imagination
of the people soars towards them after the lapse of
so many centuries, and loves to make their lofty
forms the heroes of fabulous legends. Hence it is
that the events recorded of them in the pages of the
chronicles are nearly choked up by the ever-gorgeous
poetical creations of the imagination of the people.</p>

<p>The reign of Béla I. was short (1061-1063), but
even during this brief period he succeeded in rendering
important services to his country. While he
was king paganism once more reared its crest under
the lead of James, son of the Vatha who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
put to death during Andrew’s reign. James stirred
up the multitude against Christianity and royalty,
but Béla nipped the rising in the bud. This last
attempt of paganism having failed, its power was
completely broken, and it finally lost entirely its
hold upon the imagination and passions of the
people. Some there were yet who continued to
resort secretly to the sacred places in the groves, but
their persecutors traced them even to these hallowed
spots, until, at last, the sacred fire burning on the
secretly elevated and visited altars was completely
extinguished by the laws enacted under Kings Ladislaus
and Coloman. The imperial court of Germany
made strenuous efforts to place Solomon, whom it
had received under its protection, upon the throne
of St. Stephen. Armies were collected and marched
against Hungary in the hope of being able at last
to assert the imperial supremacy over the kingdom
which had been hitherto so unsuccessfully proclaimed.
The nation shrank from young Solomon,
who was badly brought up and frivolous, and in
whom they saw only the tool of the German power.
The voice of the people designated amongst Béla’s
chivalrous sons either the righteous Geyza or the
brave and pure Ladislaus, as the princes best fitted
for the crown.</p>

<p>These generous princes, however, desiring to save
their country from the calamities of an attack by the
Germans, abdicated their power in favor of young
Solomon, and gave him a friendly reception on his
ascending the throne, stipulating only this, that their
cousin should leave them undisturbed in the posses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>sion
of their paternal inheritance, which comprised
about one third of the realm. Solomon (1063-1074)
promised every thing and kept nothing. He was
distrustful of his cousins, perceiving that the nation
idolized them, and bowed down before him only
from compulsion. It was in vain that his royal
kinsmen supported him with an unselfishness almost
touching, and strove hard to lend him the
lustre of their own popularity in order to obtain
favor for him in the eyes of the nation. Solomon
persisted in seeing in them his rivals, from whose
grasp his crown was not safe, and not his brothers,
the upholders and guardians of his royal power. The
foreign advisers poisoned the mind of the wavering
and fickle king against his young kinsmen, not because
they doubted the unselfishness of their devotion,
but because his civil counsellors well knew that
the two brothers were sworn enemies of German expansion
and supremacy. The chronicles of the country
abound in praise of the heroic deeds performed
by Solomon in conjunction with his cousins
while he lived in harmony with them, and in accounts
of the intrigues which disturbed that harmony,
and finally led to their utter estrangement from each
other. The foreign counsellors of Solomon succeeded
in working upon his fears and jealousy to such an extent
that they finally prevailed upon the king to hire
assassins to do away with Duke Geyza. The trap
was laid but the victim for whom it was destined
succeeded in making his escape. The feud of the
fathers revived in their sons, and King Solomon
and the dukes Geyza and Ladislaus confronted each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
other in the same hostile spirit in which their fathers,
Andrew and Béla, had once stood face to face. The
question which the sword was to decide was not
merely whose should be the crown, but as to
whether the German power should become the
master of the Hungarian kingdom, or not. Fate
decided against Solomon. He lost the battle of
Mogyoród, and with it his throne, and with his defeat
vanished all hopes of establishing German supremacy
over Hungary.</p>

<p>The vacant throne was filled first by Geyza (1074-1077),
and, after his short reign, by his brother Ladislaus.
Solomon escaped, and turned now to his imperial
brother-in-law, Henry IV., now again to the
adversary of the latter, Pope Gregory VII., for help,
moving heaven and earth to regain his lost throne.
It was all in vain, the mischief was done and could
be remedied no more. The chroniclers delight in
adorning the story of the erratic life and repentance
of the unfortunate youth. They relate of him that,
perceiving the utter failure of all his attempts, he
was filled with loathing against himself and the blind
passions which had made him the enemy and scourge
of his country, retired from the world, and became a
hermit in order to atone for the faults of his brief
youth by doing penance during the remaining years
of his life. A cave on the shores of the Adriatic,
near Pola, is pointed out to this day, in which
Solomon is supposed to have led the life of a hermit.
The chronicle adds that he lived to a high old
age, became the benefactor of the inhabitants of the
vicinity, prayed for his nation, and that the last wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
of his departing soul was the happiness of his
country.</p>

<p>Ladislaus (1077-1095), who succeeded his older
brother Geyza, was one of the noblest, most noteworthy
of the kings of the royal line of the Árpáds.
He was great not only in the light of the important
achievements of his reign, but by his eminent personal
qualities. His character was a happy combination
of strength without violence, of wisdom without
vacillation, of piety without fanaticism, and of lofty
majesty without pride. He was the hero, the model,
and the idol of his nation, which had never clung to
any of its kings with more boundless affection, greater
devotion, and more respect. He identified himself
with the nation, drew strength from her affection for
him, and rendered her powerful in return. He gave
the kingdom, founded by his illustrious ancestor, a
permanent peace, restored the faith in its strength,
and insured its development. He put an end to the
era of attacks from the West, and even intervened in
the troubles of Germany by siding with the papal
party against Henry IV. An ancient chronicler informs
us that he had been offered the crown of Germany
but refused to accept it, because “he wished
to be nothing but a Hungarian.” Although he aided
the popes in their contest with Germany, he yet defended
the interests of the kingdom against papal
pretensions. Pope Gregory VII. having reminded
him that the Hungarian kings had obtained their
crown from one of his predecessors, Sylvester II.,
and that it was fitting therefore that they should
submit to the supremacy of the Pope, Ladislaus re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>plied,
in a letter sent to the Pope, that “he was ready
to obey with filial submission and with his whole
heart the holy see, as an ecclesiastical power, and his
holiness the Pope, as his spiritual father, but that he
would not subordinate the independence of his realm
to anybody or any thing.” Nor did the king in his
acts deviate from his professions, and the popes
prized his alliance too highly to find it advisable
to turn his friendship into enmity by forcing upon
him their supremacy.</p>

<p>Ladislaus was not satisfied to merely defend his
people and country against hostile attacks; he exerted
himself to increase the population and to add
to the territory. Under him Croatia was added to
the kingdom (1089), and, having founded a bishopric
at Agram, he spread the Christian faith
amongst the Croatians and organized their church.
About the same time, the Kuns (Cumans), having
invaded the country from the East, Ladislaus routed
them, and, making a great number of captives
amongst them, he colonized with these prisoners the
lowlands of the Theiss. Croatia is still a member of
the realm of St. Stephen, and the Kuns have been
entirely absorbed by the Hungarian element, sharing
the weal and woe of the latter. History has preserved
in the fragments of the laws enacted by him
clear proofs of the greatness of Ladislaus in the
affairs of peace; a severe judge and wise leader, he
defended with his sword the blessed seeds planted
by him in time of peace. He compelled the people
to settle down permanently, and taught them by
severe penalties to respect the persons and property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
of others. He visited with severe punishment the
followers of ancient paganism, and overwhelmed the
Christian church with benefits. It was at his request
that Stephen, his son Emeric, and the martyred
bishop Gerhard, Duke Emeric’s tutor, were canonized
and placed upon the list of saints by the Church
of Rome. We need not wonder, therefore, if, confronted
with such grandeur and majesty, posterity
abstained from applying to him human standards,
and loved to see in his acts the manifestations of
a higher and a divine power. Thus the chronicler
speaking of him says with deep emotion: “He was
rich in love, abounding in patience, cheerful in his
graciousness, overflowing in the gifts of grace, the
promoter of justice, the patron of modesty, the
guardian of the deserted, and the helper of the poor
and distressed. Divine mercy raised him in the
gifts of nature above the common worth of man, for
he was brave, strong of arm, and pleasant to the
sight; his whole appearance was marked by leonine
strength and majesty; he was so tall of stature that
his shoulders were visible above those about him,
and, blessed with the fulness of divine gifts, his
aspect proclaimed him to have been created to be a
king.” His mortal remains lie enshrined in the
cathedral of Grosswardein (Nagyvárad), which was
built by his munificence, and the piety of the nation
has made of the place of his burial a miracle-working
resort for devout pilgrims. A pious tradition has
lived for centuries amongst the people, that whenever
danger menaces the country the king leaves his
bed of stone and, followed by the invisible hosts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a><br /><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>his departed braves, combats against the assailants
of his country.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="i134" id="i134">

<span class="caption">DUEL BETWEEN ST. LADISLAUS AND AKUS.</span></a></div>

<p>Ladislaus was still living when the religious movement
which took the form of a holy warfare began
to agitate the west of Europe—a movement which
was destined to maintain its hold upon the minds of
the inhabitants of the western world for two hundred
years. According to a tradition of the nation,
Ladislaus was offered, as the most chivalrous king,
the chief command over the western Knights and
crusading armies, but was prevented by death from
assuming the leadership. Most of the crusaders
went eastward by the valley of the Danube, passing
through Hungary, and the waves of the first expedition
reached the country during the reign of Coloman
(1095-1114), the successor of Ladislaus. It was
fortunate for the country that a king like Coloman
kept guard at this time over her frontiers; a king who,
although he may have lacked the ideal qualities of
his predecessor, possessed both the strength and the
courage to protect and defend the realm. Although
he was well aware that his attitude would provoke
the anger of the popes and place him in opposition
to the public opinion of the whole Christian world,
he was not deterred from mercilessly driving away
from the borders of the country the first motley host
of unruly and lawless crusaders that approached
them. The only crusaders to whom he gave a
friendly reception, permitting them to pass through
the country, were the troops of Godfrey of Bouillon,
but even as to these, he exacted the most rigorous
security for their good behaviour. Coloman’s firm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>ness
alone saved the country from being engulfed
by the movement, and prevented its domestic peace,
which was not as yet firmly established, from being
disturbed.</p>

<p>But while he was thus guarding the interests of
the country with a watchful eye, an unmoved heart,
and a strong arm, he still found time and opportunity
for increasing the territory of the realm. He
completed in Croatia the conquests begun by Ladislaus,
and added to the new acquisition Dalmatia,
which he wrested from the grasp of the Venetian
republic. Coloman was the first Hungarian king
who styled himself King of Croatia and Dalmatia.</p>

<p>Coloman won the admiration of his contemporaries
and posterity, not merely as a leader of
armies, but as a ruler whose great erudition and wise
laws served to perpetuate his memory. These qualities
obtained for him the epithet “<i>Könyves</i>” (bookish)
or learned King Coloman. The chronicles extol him
for putting a stop by process of law to the prosecution
of witches, and for declaring in one of his laws:
“Of witches who do not exist at all no mention
shall be made.” He bestowed great care upon the
administration of justice, and among his laws occurs
the following admirable direction given to the judges:
“Every thing must be so cautiously and anxiously
weighed on the scale of justice, that innocence, on
the one hand, shall not be condemned from hatred,
and, on the other, sin shall not be protected through
friendship.”</p>

<p>The last years of Coloman’s reign were embittered
by the ambition of his brother Álmos, who coveted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
the throne. The energetic and erudite king, who
had spent his whole life in consolidating the glorious
work begun by Stephen, saw with a sorrowing heart
how the restless ambition of single individuals was
uprooting the plants he had so carefully nursed.
Duke Álmos rose three times in rebellion against his
royal brother, nor did he reject, on these occasions,
foreign aid. Coloman defeated him each time, and
pardoned him each time. But seeing that the incorrigible
duke could not be restrained by either his
power or his magnanimity, and that he was again
collecting an army against him, Coloman caused
Álmos and his young son Béla to be thrown into
prison, where both were deprived of their sight.
This dark and cruel deed, the ferocity of which can
be palliated only by the rudeness of the age, was
Coloman’s last act, and, in thinking of the retribution
of the life to come, it could not fail to disturb
his peaceful descent into the grave.</p>

<p>The risings of Álmos initiated that period of civil
strife which continued for two hundred years, until
the house of the Árpáds became extinct, and which,
on the one hand, afforded the Greek emperors an
opportunity to meddle with the affairs of the country,
and to attempt the extension of their supremacy
over the kingdom; and, on the other hand, undermined
the authority of royalty, lifted the oligarchs
into power, and sapped the foundations of the institutions
established by Stephen.</p>

<p>Álmos, the blinded duke, planned again a rising
against Coloman’s son and successor, Stephen II.
(1114-1131), but the plot having been discovered he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
fled to the Greek court for protection and aid. The
Hungarian and Greek armies were already confronting
each other on the banks of the lower Danube,
but the shedding of blood was prevented on this
occasion by the sudden death of Duke Álmos.</p>

<p>His son Béla II. (1131-1141), who had also been
made blind, ascended the throne after the death of
Stephen II., but he gave no thought to pacifying the
restlessness of the people or to restoring peace to
the country. One feeling alone held the mastery
over his soul, shrouded in darkness—that of vindictiveness
against those who had robbed him and his
father of the light of day. His revengeful feelings
were still more fanned by his masculine queen, Ilona,
the daughter of the prince of Servia, by whose
advice he summoned the diet to meet in Arad, on
the southern confines of the country, for the sole
purpose of avenging himself on this occasion. The
lords, anticipating no evil, assembled in large
numbers, although there were many among them
who might have had good reasons for dreading
the king’s wrath. They came, however, confiding in
the forgiveness of Béla, which had been publicly
proclaimed by him. According to the information
gleaned from the chronicles, the diet was opened by
Queen Ilona herself, who, after describing in a passionate
strain the sad fate of her blinded husband,
and inveighing against the crime of those who were
the causers of his affliction, herself gave the signal for
the awful work of vengeance. A dreadful struggle
ensued between the adherents of the king and those
who had been singled out by the court as victims.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Many remained dead in the hall of the diet which
had thus been changed into a battle-field, but many
others, who succeeded in escaping, took away with
their wounds feelings of undying hatred against
their king. These bloody proceedings gave the disaffected
a fresh cause for placing their hopes in the
Greek court, and expecting from that quarter relief
from the tyranny which oppressed them.</p>

<p>But when open hostilities finally broke out between
the two nations, Béla II. was no more among
the living. When the war commenced, Geyza II.
(1141-1161), the son of Béla, sat on the Hungarian
throne, which the Emperor Manuel, the most powerful
of the Comneni, ruled in Constantinople. The
war was a protracted one, and its scene was chiefly
on the southern frontier, along the course of the
Danube and the country near the Save, but Manuel,
with all his power and wariness, was unable to obtain
an advantage over the younger and more energetic
neighbor. After the death of Geyza, his son Stephen
III. succeeded to the throne. The Greek emperor
refused to recognize him as the king of Hungary,
and attempted to place upon the throne as his vassals,
successively, the two brothers of Geyza who had
found a refuge at his court, but he did not succeed
with either of the pretenders. One of his protégés
died young, while the other was driven from the
country by the lawfully elected king, Stephen III.</p>

<p>Manuel, seeing all his schemes overthrown, and
perceiving that, as an enemy, he had utterly failed,
pretended now to feelings of friendship, and offered
peace to the Hungarians. As a further pledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
peace he requested King Stephen III. to permit
his brother Béla to reside with him at Constantinople,
promising that he would adopt him as his
son and heir. Manuel, having no sons to whom
he might leave the imperial throne, in all probability
secretly cherished the hope that his adopted
son would at some future day succeed to the Greek
throne, and would also inherit the crown of St.
Stephen, and that by this means the two neighboring
countries, which he did not succeed in uniting
by force of arms, would, in the course of time,
become one. Fate, however, seemed to have conspired
to frustrate the best laid plans of the Greek
emperor. He carried Duke Béla with him to Constantinople,
adopted him as his son, declared him
his heir, and every thing appeared to point to a
happy realization of his ambitious dreams, when unexpectedly
a son was born to him, an event which
completely upset his calculations. It became now
impossible for Manuel to continue to keep the young
Hungarian duke at his court, unless, indeed, he wanted
to raise a rival to his own son; he, therefore, deprived
him of all the distinctions he had heaped upon him,
and sent him hurriedly back to his native country,
where the throne had just become vacant by the
death of Stephen III. Manuel, however, made the
young duke take a solemn oath before he allowed
him to depart that he would never attack the Greek
empire, and this empty formality was all that he was
able to achieve in furtherance of his scheme to impose
his supremacy upon Hungary. The same duke,
however, who had been nurtured in the culture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Greece, and became King of Hungary as Béla III.,
completely banished Greek influence from the country,
and secured its independence for a long time to
come.</p>

<p>Béla III. (1173-1196) was one of the most powerful
and respected rulers of Hungary. He possessed
great kingly qualities, and his character commanded
universal respect. He had a great deal to contend
with, after his return from Constantinople, before he
succeeded in being firmly seated on his throne. He
was received with feelings of suspicion by the powerful
nobility, the chief dignitaries of the church, and
by the queen-mother herself, who all looked upon
him as a partisan of the eastern despotism, and as an
enemy to the Roman Catholic Church, and who
were anxious to place his brother Geyza upon the
throne. Béla triumphed before long over all his
enemies. He had his brother thrown into prison,
sent his mother into exile, restrained and humiliated
the powerful oligarchs, and conciliated the friendship
of the high prelacy by his munificence and liberality
towards the church of the country. Having restored
order at home, he devoted himself to the task of obtaining
again possession of the territory Manuel had
seized. The reconquering of the Dalmatian seashore
involved him in a war with Venice, the envious
rival of the Hungarian kingdom, in the course of
which Béla had occasion to give proof of his military
power on a new scene of action, where the valor of
his ancestors had never had an opportunity of shining,
by achieving over the proud republic a great
triumph on the sea. Béla had learned a great deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
at the Greek court, but all his valuable acquirements
he employed for the advantage of his country. He
did not exactly open new avenues for the development
of the nation; his chief merit consisted rather in leading
her back to the road marked out by Stephen,
and successfully pursued by King Ladislaus and
King Coloman. His every effort tended to bring
the nation closer to that western civilization which
had fostered her tender beginnings, and the rejection
of which all this time would have amounted to a
stultification of her past, and a certain risk of her
future. Two things, however, were of paramount
necessity to enable the people to prosper by the
king’s judicious exertions in this direction: to restore
to the country the needful rest she had not now
enjoyed for half a century, and to reëstablish order
within the kingdom, torn by the partisanship of the
last fifty years. Béla resolutely set to the task of
establishing peace and order. He relentlessly pursued
the thieves and robbers who rendered life and
property insecure and had increased to a frightful
extent since Coloman’s time, and, in order to do it
more effectually, he appointed special officers in
every county for that purpose, establishing, at the
same time, a royal chancery at the court with a view
to giving greater effect to the government of the
country and the administration of justice. The
proceedings in important affairs of state or private
law-suits taken before the king—which hitherto had
been oral—now had to be carried on in writing.
The country, under Béla’s well-ordered government,
became more prosperous, and the nation more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
polished. Béla’s first wife was a Greek princess,
and his second a French princess. Both the queens,
with the retinues following them to the court, introduced
there the good taste, culture, and manners of
the Greeks and French, so that a German chronicler
happening to visit the court at that time, could not
find adequate words to extol its magnificent splendors.
Culture was not confined to the court; it
spread to the nation itself, for we find that the university,
recently established in Paris, was attended
by a number of Hungarian youths. All the acts of
Béla indicate that he had selected for his model in
government one of his most distinguished ancestors,
Ladislaus, for whom, as an expression of his own
and the nation’s piety, he had also, in 1192, secured
a place on the list of saints recognized by the Church
of Rome.</p>

<p>Béla, while thus advancing the interests of the
kingdom and the nation, did not lose sight of the
claims of the age upon kings and rulers to support
the holy wars waged by Christendom against the infidels.
He followed with sympathy the movements
of the crusaders, and upon Jerusalem’s falling into
the hands of the infidels in 1187, he planned himself
to lead an army for the purpose of reconquering the
holy city. The third crusade was begun in 1189, and
the German forces, under the lead of the emperor,
Frederic Barbarossa, passed on their way to the
Holy Land through Hungary. Béla received his
distinguished guest with royal pomp, abundantly
provided the German troops with every thing necessary,
but he himself did not join the crusaders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
What the circumstances were that prevented the
king from taking part in the crusades it would be
difficult now to determine, but that they must have
been weighty ones is amply proved by the fact that
he had been long preparing for a crusading campaign,
and had for that purpose collected a great deal of
treasure. The idea was present before his mind at the
time of his death, for he directed that his elder son,
Emeric, should succeed him on the throne, and the
younger, Duke Andrew, should inherit the treasure
collected for the pious object, and employ it in the
carrying out of the paternal intentions. Béla’s fate
had that in common with the fate of the most conspicuous
kings of Hungary—that posterity praised
his grand achievements, while his own children
failed to respect and preserve the inheritance left to
them by a distinguished sire.</p>

<p>The feud between the two brothers broke out
immediately after the death of Béla III. Andrew
collected troops for the pretended purpose of executing
the last will of his father, but in reality to
employ them against his own brother. He succeeded
in defeating the army of King Emeric, who was
taken unawares, and was, besides, vacillating and incapable,
and, after occupying Croatia and Dalmatia,
to which he added fresh territory, he proclaimed
himself, in 1198, Duke of Croatia, Dalmatia, Rama,
and Chulmia (Bosnia and Herzegovina). Emeric
vainly urged Innocent III., the most powerful pope
since Gregory VII., to compel the rebellious duke
to carry out the pious vows of his father. Andrew
did not stir one step towards the Holy Land, but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
persevering in his sinful perverseness, continued to
repeat his attacks against the lawful king. At last,
during one of his outbreaks, he was overtaken by
an avenging Nemesis.</p>

<p>The armies of the two brothers confronted each
other on the banks of the Drave. The camp of
Andrew was stirring with a strong and numerous
army which, in anticipation of a certain victory, was
loudly revelling and making merry. King Emeric’s
eyes sadly surveyed his own scant following, whose
devotion and determination, great as they were, did
not seem sufficient to make up for the deficiency in
numbers. The collision between the opposing armies
was inevitable, and the king felt that his utter discomfiture
would be the result of the battle. His
desperate condition inspired him with a sudden
resolution, and, without communicating his intention
to any one, he went into the enemy’s camp, dressed
in kingly state, and, sceptre in hand, made straight
for his brother’s tent. The revelling warriors, in
surprise, were struck with awe at the marvellous
spectacle suddenly bursting in upon their dazed eyes.
“I wish to see the man who will dare to raise a sinful
arm against his king and master,” were the magic
words which opened him the way through the gaping
multitude. Upon arriving in his brother’s tent he
seized the rebellious duke’s hands and led him
captive to his own camp. The above narrative of
the event, as gleaned from the chronicles, may not
agree in every particular with the actual occurrence,
but Duke Andrew became the king’s prisoner, and
remained captive until the latter called him to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
deathbed, generously confiding to his care his infant
son, Ladislaus, who had already been crowned king.</p>

<p>Andrew proved as faithless a guardian as he had
been a false brother. He could not restrain his ambition,
but deprived Ladislaus of his crown, and
drove him and his mother from the court. Shortly
afterwards, the unhappy youth died, and Andrew
could, at last, in 1205, ascend the throne he had so
long coveted, and whose possession he had attempted
to achieve by means in the choice of which
he never consulted his conscience.</p>

<p>The reign of Andrew II. (1205-1235) deserves a
conspicuous place in the history of Hungary, not for
its beneficence, but for its weakness and shortcomings.
The never-ending civil wars of the last century,
especially the internecine struggle between the two
brothers, had the effect of weakening the kingdom,
lowering the royal power and authority, and, as a
consequence of the decay of the latter, of increasing
the overbearing spirit of the oligarchs. Andrew II.
could not escape the condign punishment brought
upon himself by his own acts. His whole reign
was a series of feeble attempts to free himself from
the entangling web caused by his own faults and
the licentiousness of the oligarchy. He presented
the spectacle of a man whose ambition was greater
than his abilities, and whose levity equalled his
ambition. In the beginning of his reign he was
completely under the influence of his wife, Gertrude,
who was of Tyrolese descent, and who suffered the
country to become a prey to her foreign relations
and favorites. Yet when the great and powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
lords rose against the plundering foreigners, the
licentious court, and the tyrannical and wicked
queen, killing the latter in her own palace, Andrew
had neither the courage nor the power to exert his
royal authority against the rebels, but was rather
glad that the storm had passed over his head and
had not singled him out for its victim. Instead of resenting
the injury done to him, he conciliated his
enemies by presents and gifts, and indulged in
schemes of a new matrimonial alliance. He was
fond of pomp, splendor, generous expenditure, and
the ostentatious display of the court, but the royal
revenues soon proved inadequate to pay the sums
thus squandered, reduced as the royal domains had
been by grants of entire counties. The king, in
order to raise the revenues, mortgaged the imposts
and tolls, and, by debasing the coinage, dishonestly
added to his resources. The din of the revels of
the court prevented the loud complaints of the
people, who were oppressed and worried in a thousand
ways by the oligarchs and the tax-and toll-gatherers,
from reaching the ears of the king. At
times his restlessness and ambition still involved
him in adventurous enterprises. Thus he wished
to elevate his son, Duke Béla, to the throne of
Galicia, but lacked the strength to accomplish his
scheme. The campaign against Galicia only added
to the expenditures of the country, and, indeed, it
happened that the king with his son and the whole
army were in the most imminent danger of destruction.
His mind was also disturbed by his failure to
carry out the wishes of his father, and, at last, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
determined, in 1217, to march an army to the Holy
Land. In order to raise the money necessary for the
campaign he plundered the churches and monasteries,
and sold to Venice the city of Zara, the bulwark
of the Dalmatian seashore. He finally left the
country with the army thus collected, but while he
was roaming about in the Holy Land without aim or
purpose, the orphaned country was reduced to the
brink of misery. “When we returned home from
our expedition,” complained the king himself, in a
letter addressed to the holy see, “we found that
both the clergy and the laymen had been guilty of
wickedness such as surpasses all imagination. All
the treasure of the country we found squandered,
and fifteen years will not suffice to restore our land
to her former better condition.” The condition of
the country must have been sad, indeed, if the state
the king had left her in might be called good in comparison
with it, and however heavily the responsibility
of the fresh calamities rested upon the king,
his truthfulness in this instance cannot be doubted.</p>

<p>The gloomy rule of Andrew II. was relieved by
one cheering event which contained the germ of a
better future. The gentry, comprising in its ranks
the largest part of the freeholders of the country,
unable to bear longer the weak government of the
king, the violence of the oligarchy, and the scourge
of the army of extortionate gatherers of taxes and
tolls, at last lifted their heads and asked the throne
to listen to their complaints and to remedy their
wrongs. Béla himself, the king’s son, whom Andrew
II. had caused to be crowned before going to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Holy Land, was the leader and spokesman of the
nobility, who had stood up in defence of the sacredness
of the constitution, and who now urged the
return to the rule of law in the land.</p>

<p>Their wrongs, and the remedies exacted by the
gentry were set forth in the following strain: The
king should not, at the expense of the patriots, bestow
favors upon foreigners, nor elevate them to
dignities, and distribute among them the domains
of the country; entire counties or dignities of state
should not, as a practice, be granted in perpetuity,
and he should not suffer avaricious nobles to grasp a
greater number of offices than they could efficiently
administer. He should guard the ancient immunities
of the nobles, so that they might freely dispose
of their property, and not be molested in their persons
without lawful judgment, and should not be
burdened with taxes or extortionate exactions of
any kind. He should take care that the tax-and
toll-gatherers and other officials be taken from the
ranks of the gentry, and should remove from his service
the Ishmaelites and the Jews. Every thing opposed
to these requirements he should at once bring
to an end. The county estates, granted away to the
injury of the land or dishonestly obtained, should be
taken back by the king, and he should, in pursuance
of the ancient custom of the country, every year, on
St. Stephen’s day, convoke the diet, whose duty it
was to act upon the complaints of the nation and to
defend her liberty when attacked.</p>

<p>The king, however, moved neither by the voice of
truth, nor by the misery of his people, refused to ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>cede
to these requests. In the breast of Andrew II.,
who, during his whole reign, had utterly neglected
the duties coupled with his exalted station, awoke
on the present occasion a feeling of injured royal
dignity. But the gentry were determined to enforce
their demands, and, gathering around the heir to the
throne, they took up arms in order to obtain by force
the concessions they deemed necessary for the good
of the country. Father and son with their armies
were already confronting each other, when the chief
prelates interfered, and prevailed upon Andrew to
listen to the wishes of the gentry. The concessions
were drawn up in form of a royal letter and the king
bound himself and his successors by oath to observe
the stipulations contained in it. Posterity has given
this royal letter the name of the <i>Golden Bull</i>, owing
to the fact that the seal appended to it by a silk
string rests in a box made of gold.</p>

<p>This remarkable document, which terminated the
internal strife extending over a period of a hundred
years, and to which for six centuries the past generations
of Hungary were in the habit of proudly referring
as the foundation of the constitution of the Hungarian
nobility, reads, omitting passages of minor
importance, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the name of the Holy Trinity and of the indivisible Unity,
Andrew, by the grace of God, hereditary king of Hungary, Dalmatia,
Croatia, Rama, Servia, and Galicia: Whereas the nobles and others
in our realm have suffered detriment in many parts of their liberties,
as established by King St. Stephen, through the power of some kings—who,
either from anger revenged themselves, or listened to the
counsels of wicked advisers, or sought their own advantage,—and our
nobles have frequently appealed to our Majesty’s and our ancestors’
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>ears with petitions and complaints concerning the amelioration of our
land—we, therefore, as in duty bound, desirous of satisfying their
request, grant to them as well as to the other inhabitants of our realm
the liberty granted by the sacred king, and we further ordain other
matters pertaining to the improvement of the land in this wise: We
ordain that we are bound annually to celebrate the day of the sacred
king at Stuhlweissenburg and that, if we should be prevented from
being present, the palatine shall be there in our place and shall hear
the causes as our representative, and all the nobles may freely assemble
there according to their pleasure. It is also our will, that neither
we nor our successors shall detain or oppress the nobles on account
of any powerful person, unless they be first summoned and sentenced
by due process of law. Further we shall not cause taxes to
be collected on the estates of the nobles or of the clergy of the Church.
If a noble shall die without male issue his daughter shall be entitled
to one fourth of his property; as to the rest he may dispose of it as
he pleases, and if death should intervene before his doing so it shall descend
to his nearer relatives, and if he is absolutely without kin then
the inheritance shall go to the king. If the king is desirous of taking
troops out of the country the nobles shall not be bound to go with him
unless at his expense; if, however, an army should invade the country
all the nobles are bound to go. The palatine shall be judge over
all the people of our realm without distinction; but in capital cases
and matters of property which concern the nobles the palatine shall
not decide without the king’s knowledge. If foreigners come to the
country they shall not be elevated to dignities without the consent
of the council of the realm; land shall not be given to those who
are strangers to the realm. The king shall not grant entire counties
or offices of any kind in perpetuity. Officers of the treasury, salt
bureaux, and customs must be nobles of our realm; Ishmaelites and
Jews shall be incapable of holding such offices. Excepting these four
great lords, the palatine, the banus, the court judges of the king and
queen, no one shall have two dignities at the same time. Should,
however, we, or any of our successors, at any time be disposed to
infringe upon any of these our orders, the bishops as well as the
other lords and the nobles of the realm, shall be at liberty, jointly
or singly, by virtue of this letter, to oppose and contradict us and
our successors, forever, without incurring the penalty of treason.
Given by the hand of Kletus, the chancellor of our court, in the
year of grace one thousand two hundred and twenty-two.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>King Andrew, who had to be compelled by force
to issue the Golden Bull, could, however, not be
coerced by any power to observe the promises he
had made therein. The exertions of the heir presumptive
and the nobility as well as the wrath of the
pope were of no avail. Nine years later he confirmed
its contents by a fresh oath, but hardly two
years elapsed when he incurred the curse of Rome
for again disregarding his oath. Struggles, extending
over many centuries, were necessary to realize
the words of the Golden Bull. Time had then
already effaced the memory of Andrew’s follies and
frailties, and posterity saw him only in the reflected
light of the great concessions made by his royal
missive. The estates of the diet which met at
Rákos in 1505 spoke of him in terms of extravagant
praise as the king “who had made the Hungarians
great and glorious, and had raised their fame to the
very stars.”</p>

<p>The struggles which resulted in the issuing of the
Golden Bull were by no means over. The nobility
had obtained from royalty the concession of their
rights, but were lacking the power to maintain them,
and to secure their permanency. The very charter
of their liberties furnished matter for fresh disputes
and dissensions. In these contests, however, the
nobility now seldom attacked royalty, the weakening
of which would have proved injurious to their
own interests, but they usually allied themselves
with the kings against the oligarchs, who treated
with contempt both law and right, having no need
of the protection of either, and who indulged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
tyrannical violence against the throne as well as the
nation. The licentiousness and increasing power of
the oligarchs were the sore spot in the body politic
during the period of the last Árpáds, and in a greater
and lesser degree, now apparently healed, now more
envenomed than ever, it continued to be for centuries
a disturbing element in the public life of the
country.</p>

<p>The struggle between royalty, supported by the
nation, and the unruly great lords had just commenced,
when the storm of the Mongol invasion
broke loose upon the country, shaking it to its very
foundations. When the storm subsided only the
weak ones were found to have suffered, the strong
ones came out of the nation’s calamity more powerful
than ever. The national misfortunes only served
to advance the interests of the oligarchs, who, about
this time, began more frequently to surround the
crests of the mountains with stone walls, and, dwelling
in their rocky nests, defied royalty with increasing
boldness, and oppressed the people with greater
impunity than ever. The chroniclers in recalling
this period mourn with bitter wailing the gloom
which had settled upon the country, the incapacity
of the kings, the pride and violence of the lords, and
the miserable condition of the people. That the
power of the nation was not entirely gone, however,
was shown by the cheering fact, casting a ray of
light into the gloom of those days, that at the very
time when the authority of royalty had sunk to the
lowest ebb, the Hungarian arms were able to cope
with the powerful Slavic empire ruled by Ottokar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
king of Bohemia, and to assist in establishing the
power of the Hapsburgs. Unfortunately the national
strength was for the most part divided against itself,
and the very triumph of the Hungarian arms against
Ottokar proved injurious to the nation at large, for
it redounded only to the glory of the oligarchy, and
tended to confirm their power.</p>

<p>After the death of Andrew II., his son, Béla IV.
(1235-1270), devoted himself with youthful energy
to the task of restoring the ascendancy of the royal
power and authority, of insuring respect to the laws,
and of humbling the pride of the oligarchy. He removed
the evil counsellors of his father, sent the
principal ringleaders to prison, surrounded himself
with good patriots, and where gentle words proved
inefficacious he resorted to arms in order to obtain
possession of the royal domains and county lands
which single oligarchs had contrived to acquire by
grant during his father’s life or from his ancestors,
or which had been lawlessly appropriated by them.
The efforts made by the youthful king were, however,
of no avail. The very successes which attended
here and there his policy served only to excite to
a higher pitch the anger and resentment of the great
lords, and deepened the estrangement between them
and the throne. The disaffected oligarchs, whose
selfishness was not tempered by patriotism, and
whose passions did not know the bridle of the law,
were so base as to elevate a foreign prince, Duke
Frederic of Austria, to the throne, in opposition
to their lawful king. The watchfulness of Béla
alone prevented the royal inheritance from passing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
at that time already, from the Árpáds into foreign
hands. Béla succeeded in driving back Frederic,
and in defeating the treasonable schemes of the oligarchy,
but he became, at the same time, convinced
that until he was able to present to the opposing
lords a more formidable front he would have to renounce
the realization of the fond hopes of his
youth.</p>

<p>Béla looked about him for fresh resources to
strengthen his authority and to add to his power.
Pious Dominican monks, just then returning to the
country from the regions of the Volga, told the tale
that in the far east, along the banks of that river,
they met with that fraction of the Hungarians who,
during the period preceding the occupation of Hungary,
had parted from their brethren near the Black
Sea, where the latter continued their march westward.
These accounts suggested to Béla the scheme
of inviting the distant Eastern brothers to settle in
his realm, hoping to augment the royal power by the
aid of the new settlers, and to be thus enabled to
resume successfully his contest with the proud lords.
This scheme, however, failed, but the same circumstances
which frustrated his plans as to his countrymen
near the Volga, assisted him in obtaining aid
from another quarter. The Mongol hordes, which
came rushing from Central Asia toward the western
world, swept in their impetuous onward march the
Hungarians near the Volga out of existence; but the
same wild current drove also the Kuns (Cumans) out
of their habitations near the Black Sea, and the latter,
after having roamed about homeless for a time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
then reached the frontiers of Hungary, begged of
King Béla to allow them to come into the country and
to settle there. Forty thousand families were in search
of a new country, and forty thousand fierce warriors
offered their services to King Béla. The people of
Hungary were averse to receiving immigration on so
large a scale, and the great lords loudly protested
against the reception of the new comers, being convinced
that the latter would only enhance the king’s
power, and become instrumental in humbling their
order. The king, however, considering the good
of the country only, braved the opposition, and admitting
Kuthen, king of the Kuns, with his people,
into the land, assigned to them as their future abode
the plain of the Theiss. Nor did he forget to make
their conversion to Christianity a condition of their
admission. The good effects Béla had anticipated
from his new colony were slow in showing themselves,
but the evil consequences of the recent settlement
became manifest at once. The great numbers
of this rude and barbarous element, who were as
little disposed to live in fixed habitations as to embrace
Christianity, soon disgusted the people by
their lawlessness, violence, unruliness, and the devastations
committed by them amongst the Hungarian
population. The complaints of all classes,
without distinction, which reached the king’s ear,
became daily louder. Béla was unable to come to
the relief of the people, for to have turned against
the Kuns, as he was asked to do, would have shaken
them in their fidelity to him. But by showing a
preference for the new comers he also forfeited the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
affection of his old adherents, the good patriots who
had firmly stood by him, hitherto, in all his troubles.
Dissensions arose between the king, who was animated
by the purest intentions, and his people, who
were unable to fathom the patriotic motives of his
actions; and they were at their highest when the
hurricane which had swept away the Hungarians on
the banks of the Volga, and driven the Kuns to the
plains of the Theiss, reached at last the crests of the
Carpathian mountains.</p>

<p>The successors of Jenghis Khan, wishing to extend
the frontiers of their vast Asiatic empire toward
the west, crossed the Volga, overran the Russian
steppes, and reduced Moscow to ashes in 1238.
Proud and beautiful Kiev was soon after, in 1240,
humbled by their victorious arms. The Hungarians
were aware of the approach of the formidable foe,
but their internal dissensions, and their troubles
with the Kuns and with their king, made them
forget the imminence of the danger that menaced
them. They indulged, besides, in the hope that
the mighty Carpathian mountains would arrest the
fierce current in its onward course. But the nation
was soon roused from its fancied security and awoke
to a dread sense of the true situation. The mournful
fate of Kiev, the sufferings of the Polish people,
and the threatening language of the embassy sent by
Batu Khan, the general of Oktai, the Great Khan,
who had been the terror of the Russians, dispelled
the illusions, of the most sanguine.</p>

<p>The mind of King Béla was beset with anxious
thoughts, but his courage did not fail him. Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
it was rather late for efficient military preparations,
he labored day and night to put the country into a
state of defence against the coming peril. He
demolished the forests, and barricaded with the
timber thus obtained the Carpathian passes. He invited
his adherents to take counsel with him, and
called to arms the ecclesiastical and lay lords, the
soldiery of the counties, and every man in the country
capable of bearing arms. According to ancient
custom he caused the bloody sword to be carried
about throughout the land. His active zeal was not
confined to his realm alone, but, sending his ambassadors
to the western courts, he instructed them to
beg, admonish, and urge the rulers of the West, in
the name of Christianity, to come to his aid. It was
all in vain. The foreign courts did not stir, and the
Hungarian lords, in their surprise and dismay, instead
of devising means to meet the danger, were wildly
looking about them for some one to be made responsible
for the coming peril, and to serve as a victim
of their anger. They turned with passionate hatred
upon the king and the Kuns, saying that he with his
Kuns should defend the country, and that the king
need not count upon them in this emergency. The
spring of 1241 was already nearing, and still the
royal banner, floating over Pesth, proclaimed to the
world the absence of troops and the defencelessness
of the country. The Mongolian armies had, meanwhile,
already begun to press forward. Their right
wing marched on Poland and Silesia, in order to
effect an entrance into the country from the north-west;
the left wing, passing through Moldavia, ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>proached
the snowy mountains of Transylvania;
whilst the army of the centre was led by Batu Khan
himself across the northwestern Carpathians to the
pass of Bereczke. Thus the two arms of the Mongol
armies were preparing to crush, in a deadly embrace,
the doomed country.</p>

<p>Batu Khan crossed the Carpathians on the 12th of
March, 1241, and, having dispersed the troops of
Palatine Héderváry, at the foot of the mountains,
the active Mongol cavalry troops overran with such
suddenness the plain watered by the Theiss, that
four days later the smoke of the burning villages, set
on fire by the ruthless enemy, could be discerned
from the walls of Pesth. The Hungarian lords, even
at this critical moment, failed to arrive with their
contingents, and those who were under arms near
Pesth nursed their wrath, not against the enemy,
but against the hated Kun immigrants whom they
denounced as the spies and allies of the Mongols,
and as traitors to Hungary. They rushed upon
the unsuspecting Kuns with savage rage, massacring
their king, Kuthen, together with his household, at
his quarters in Pesth. The Kuns, incensed at this
treachery, were not slow to retaliate. One portion
of them left the country, killing, burning, and devastating
every thing before them, whilst the other
joined the Mongols in order to avenge more thoroughly
their unjust persecution.</p>

<p>Towards the latter end of March, Béla, inspired by
despair rather than by any hope of success, led the
royal army which had gathered around Pesth, and
numbered altogether from 50,000 to 60,000 warriors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
against the Mongols. This scanty force was all that
the Hungarian nation, shorn of its valor and sadly
wanting in public spirit, opposed to the invading
enemy. The Mongol army retreated before Béla as
far as the Theiss, and there Batu Khan, falling back
with both wings of his army, pitched his camp in
the angle formed by the Sajó and the Theiss. King
Béla was intent upon reaching the same point, and
placed his forces on the plain extending along the
right bank of the Sajó, opposite the Mongol camp.
Here on the plain of Muhi took place the dreadful
conflict between the two armies. From the dawn
of day to late in the night lasted the bloody engagement
which ended with the complete annihilation of
the Hungarian army. On the fated battle-field perished
the chief prelates of the church, the highest
dignitaries of the state taken from the ranks of the
best patriots, thousands of the gentry, and the hope
and last prop of the nation, her only army. Only
few amongst those who did not fall amidst the shock
of battle could escape with their lives. The pursuing
enemy was everywhere close upon the track of
the fugitives. “During a march of two days,” says
Rogerius, a contemporary writer, who had been an
eye-witness of these horrors, “thou couldst see
nothing along the roads but fallen warriors. Their
dead bodies were lying about like stones in a
quarry.”</p>

<p>Yet, amidst all these misfortunes, there was one
gleam of comfort in store for the nation. Every
thing, indeed, was lost, but her king was saved, and
whilst he lived the nation still kept up her hopes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
faith in a better future. A few devoted followers
had rescued Béla from the perils of the bloody engagement
near the banks of the Sajó, and the fugitive
king, wandering for a while amidst the mountains
of Upper Hungary, finally arrived at the court
of Frederic, Duke of Austria, to whom he had previously
sent his family and royal treasures. Here,
however, instead of meeting with hospitality, he was
made prisoner, and succeeded in regaining his freedom
only by abandoning to his avaricious neighbor,
who turned Béla’s misfortunes to his profit, his
treasures, his crown, and the possession of three
counties. Béla then sent his family to the Dalmatian
seashore, whilst he himself hurried back to his
unfortunate land, to the region near the Drave, in
order to save what could yet be saved. The Danube
alone interfered with the further advance of the
Mongols. Two thirds of the realm had already
fallen a prey to the fierce rage, greed, and brutal
passions of the enemy. Whilst the Mongol Khan
was dividing one half of the country, as conquered
territory, into hundredths and tenths, and the people,
lured from their hiding-places, lowered their necks,
terror-stricken under the new yoke, Béla collected
anew an army in the western part of the realm, and
despatched ambassadors to the rulers of the western
states. But before he could yet see the results of
his renewed exertions, the severity of the winter, by
covering the Danube with ice, afforded the Mongols
an opportunity to penetrate into the Western half of
the country. The places which guarded the most
sacred memorials of Hungarian royalty and Christi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>anity,
became a mass of smouldering ruins. The
waves of the Mongolian inundation closed now
upon the entire land. Béla was again compelled to
seek safety in flight, and, mistrusting the continent,
he sought a refuge near the sea. He retired, together
with his family, first to Spalato, and subsequently
to his fortified castle Trau, which was defended
on almost every side by the sea. But his
pursuers, who seemed to look upon their victories as
incomplete as long as the king was not in their
power, were on his track even there, and, devastating
the seashore, as far as Ragusa, they, at last,
desperate with rage, laid siege to Trau.</p>

<p>The last hopes of the nation had centred upon the
sea-fortress, and now these hopes, too, seemed to
vanish, when suddenly, as by a miracle, the besiegers
ceased their hostilities, folded up their tents, and
departed for the East. At the command of Batu
Khan the whole Mongolian army, with all their followers,
left the razed country, the flood of the invaders
receding to the banks of the Volga, whence it
had come. Oktai, the Great Khan, was dead, and Batu
Khan hurried back to be present at the funeral feast,
and to make his powerful voice, emphasized by the
arms of his entire army, felt in the election of the
new ruler.</p>

<p>After the Mongols had withdrawn, King Béla returned,
in company of a few of his trusty followers,
to his desolated land. He tottered under the weight
of the misfortunes and woes of his people. To use
the words of a contemporary writer and eye-witness
describing the scene of desolation which met Béla’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
eyes: “Here and there a tower, half burnt and blackened
by smoke, and rearing its head towards the
sky, like a mourning flag over a funereal monument,
indicated the direction in which they were to advance.
The highways were overgrown with grass,
the fields white with bleaching bones, and not a living
soul came out to meet them. And the deeper
they penetrated into the land, the more terrible
became the sights they saw. When at last those
who survived crept forth from their hiding-places,
half of them fell victims to wild animals, starvation,
and pestilence. The stores laid up by the tillers of
the soil, the year before, had been carried away by
the Mongols, and the little grain they could sow after
the departure of the enemy had hardly sprung up
when it was devoured by locusts. The famine assumed
such frightful proportions that starving people,
in their frenzy, killed each other, and it happened
that men would bring to market human flesh
for sale. Since the birth of Christ no country has
ever been overwhelmed by such misery.”</p>

<p>Great deeds spring up in noble souls harrowed by
misfortune. Béla showed himself greatest in the extreme
misery of his nation. In order to relieve the
wants of the people and to enable them to till the
soil, he caused to be imported seed for sowing and
draught cattle from the neighboring countries. He
colonized with new inhabitants the depopulated
regions, held out inducements to German artisans,
miners, and traders to settle in towns, and invited
again the Kuns, who were roaming in the regions of
the Lower Danube, to return to their former habita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a><br /><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>tions
on the rich lands of the Theiss. He bestowed
especial care upon the cities, founded new ones, and
granted additional privileges to the old ones. He
was also the founder of Buda, which stands to this
day. He ordered the larger cities to be surrounded
by walls, caused forts, built of stone, to be erected
in the neighborhood of more important roads, and
encouraged the great lords to build similar forts.
He was careful to guard the eastern frontiers, but
remembering that the durability of the internal order
was as powerful a support of the security of the
land as well defended frontiers, he was bent upon
making the laws respected. Hardly five years had
passed since Béla engaged in his arduous task, and
already the country recuperated to such an extent
that the nation could receive with composure the
news that the Mongols were making fresh preparations
for a second attack, and was even, for years,
able to turn the weight of her whole power against
the Western states.</p>

<span class="caption">BELA IV. RETURNS TO HIS COUNTRY DEVASTATED BY THE MONGOLS.</span></a></div>

<p>The nation which stood in such great need of
peace, was unfortunately doomed never to enjoy its
blessings. Béla himself, as soon as he had gained
sufficient strength, deemed it his first duty to punish
Frederic, the faithless Austrian duke, and to recover
the treasures retained by the latter’s treachery.
The war between the two neighbors began in
1246. The contest in itself was of no great significance
but its consequences were highly important.
Béla achieved, with the help of his Kun warriors, a
complete triumph over Frederic, who lost his life
on the battle-field. Frederic was the last of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
Babenberg line, and the inheritance of the Babenbergs,
the Austrian principalities, were, through his
death, left without a master. Béla coveted for himself
the masterless countries, but was opposed in
his schemes in that direction by Ottokar, the powerful
king of Bohemia, who then already labored for
the realization of his ambitious dream, the founding
of a great Slavic empire. The Hungarian king
could not expose his country to the dangers involved
in the erection of such a Slavic empire
along the western borders, and was therefore opposed,
from the beginning, to Ottokar’s aspirations.
The contest between Hungary and Bohemia was at
first waged for the Babenberg possessions, but its
original cause was lost sight of, and the war continued
for many years, to terminate only with the
overthrow of Ottokar and the ruin of his empire.
Béla was engaged in these wars during the last years
of his reign, and they were continued by his son Stephen
V., and his grandson Ladislaus IV.</p>

<p>These wars brought into a community of interests
the kings of the house of Árpád and the Hapsburgs,
whose first great ancestor, Rudolph, ascended
in 1273, the German imperial throne, the stability of
which was endangered by Ottokar. The latter had
seceded from the German empire, and was now building
up at its expense his own great Slavic kingdom.
It was quite natural, therefore, that Ladislaus IV.,
King of Hungary, and Rudolph of Hapsburg, should
enter into an armed alliance for the purpose of combating
the common enemy, who, confident in his
power, threatened both his eastern and his western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
neighbor. Twice they led their joint armies against
Ottokar, and, at last, in the course of the second
campaign in 1278, they completely routed the Czech
armies near Stillfried and Diernkrut in the plain of
the Morava, or March. Side by side with Rudolph’s
ten thousand men fought forty thousand Kun warriors
against Ottokar, the preponderance of the Hungarian
arms securing at last the triumph of the allies.
Ottokar’s power was overthrown and he himself fell,
buried beneath the ruins of his kingdom. Rudolph
strengthened the German throne, whose fate the
events of subsequent centuries closely identified with
that of his family, and the Austrian principalities
became the hereditary provinces of the Hapsburgs.
Hungary derived but an unequal benefit from this
triumph. To be sure the gratitude of the ally, freed
from a formidable enemy, was fervent, and his vows
of friendship (not always respected by his successors)
most earnest. Thus Rudolph writes to Ladislaus
IV.: “Tongue cannot tell, nor pen describe, the
immense joy we feel at your having risen with so
powerful a force to avenge our common injuries.
Wherefore, glorifying God, we express the greatest
gratitude of which we are capable to your Majesty,
and loudly promise that no vicissitude shall shake
us in the indissoluble alliance which we have vowed to
you.” The booty, gratifying the avarice of a few
and the vanity of the nation, could also hardly be
reckoned a solid advantage. One important result
accrued, undoubtedly by the triumph of the allies,
also to Hungary, in the destruction of Ottokar’s
Slavic kingdom. In other respects the victory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
proved rather a disadvantage, for, instead of strengthening
the power of the state, it relieved the minds
of the powerful lords in the land, who now, freed
from anxiety, once more indulged their self-seeking
propensities, and labored to ruin the country.</p>

<p>Ladislaus IV. (1272-1290) not only did not possess
the qualities which might have enabled him to oppose
the corruption of his age, but, by his levity, undermined
even the last remnant of the royal authority
which had become more and more feeble in the
course of the last century. The king, unmindful of
his crown, and indifferent to the interests of the
nation, deserted his ancestral court, and, pitching
his residence amongst the tents of the Kuns, passed
there his life in the society of his boon companions
in riotous living and revels, destructive alike of his
dignity as a man and king, and detrimental to the
hopes of the nation. The great of the land imitated
the example set by their king. They were led exclusively
by their insatiate self-indulgence, and
neither the law of the land nor the commands of the
Church, the voice of faith or morality, could prevail
upon them to respect themselves, and to have regard
for the rights of others. The weak became the
victims of the strong, and the most powerful were
making preparations to divide amongst themselves
the masterless and defenceless country. The Brebiris
along the sea-shore, the Németujváris beyond
the Danube, the Csák family in the regions of the
Vág, and the Apors in Transylvania, were in reality
the little kings of the country. They broke off a
piece from the domain of St. Stephen whenever it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
suited them, and of the size they wanted. They let
their troops loose upon the people, and carried on
wars in their own way with one another, and with
the neighbors. And if any thing escaped the greed
of the oligarchs, it fell into the hands of the Kuns,
who, trusting in the protection and favor of the
king, plundered and devastated the land like marauding
armies. “Then descended,” says the chronicler,
“Hungary from the grandeur of her glory. Owing
to the domestic wars the cities became deserted and
the villages reduced to ashes, peace and harmony were
trampled upon, the wealthy became impoverished,
and the nobles, in their misery, turned peasants. It
was at this period that the two-wheeled cart got
the name of St. Ladislaus’ wagon, for owing to the
universal plundering of the draught-cattle, the number
of the latter had decreased to such an extent that people
were compelled to draw these carts themselves.”</p>

<p>The country before long, however, was free from
the misrule of Ladislaus, but his death did not extricate
it from the misery into which he had plunged
it. A number of Kun youths, apparently from
motives of private vengeance, assassinated him in his
tent. The death of Ladislaus became a new source
of trouble to the country, for there was now but one
male descendant of the house of Árpád to ascend
the throne, Duke Andrew, the grandson of Andrew
II., the king who had given the Golden Bull to the
Hungarians. Stephen, the father of Duke Andrew,
had left Hungary early in life, and, settling in Venice,
married there Tomasina Morozzoni, a lady descended
from a distinguished patrician family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>Andrew III. (1290-1301), the last king of Hungary
of the Árpád line, was born in Venice, where he received
his education and remained until he attained
the age of manhood. Hitherto he had lived entirely
a stranger to the events which had plunged the
country with rapid strides into the uttermost misery.
There were many within the land, and among
the neighbors abroad, who did not look upon him as
a genuine Hungarian and who refused to acknowledge
his right to the inheritance of the Árpáds. During
his brief reign he gave, nevertheless, ample
proofs of possessing abilities befitting an eminent
ruler, and no blame can attach to him for having been
unable with his inadequate strength and power to
contend against the difficulties of that period. To
put down the little kings in the country, and to keep
away from the borders those foreign powers who,
under the pretence of kinship and led by unblushing
avariciousness, announced their claims to the inheritance
at this early date, was a task to which Andrew
III. was not equal. But he struggled bravely and
manfully against the difficulties that beset his royal
path. He opposed to the oligarchs the gentry,
whose ancient immunities he confirmed, and whom
he attached to his person by granting them new
ones. Duke Albert of Austria, the son of Rudolph
of Hapsburg, who was the first to claim the throne,
was driven from the country, but the diplomacy of
Andrew turned him subsequently from an enemy
into a friend and ally. He entered upon the contest
with the Neapolitan Anjous, who, being the descendants
in the female line of the Árpáds, were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
most pressing and determined claimants to the
throne. But at the very outset of the struggle,
when the shock of the collision of hostile interests is
generally most severe, and just as Andrew was preparing
to enter upon the campaign against Charles
Robert of Naples, death suddenly took him in 1301.
The chronicles contain traces of a suspicion that he
died by poison administered by his Italian cook, who
had been hired for that foul purpose by the Neapolitan
party, and that thus, the doom of the house of
Árpád was sealed by the wiles of an assassin. The sun
of the Árpáds set amidst dark and storm-portending
clouds, and the new dynasty of Anjou inherited
the great task of reconciling the oligarchs with the
gentry, and both classes with the crown, and thus of
restoring the ancient power and splendor of the
Hungarian kingdom.<br /><br /></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br /><br />

<small>THE ANJOUS IN HUNGARY.</small></h2>

<p>The male line of the house of Árpád became extinct
by the death of Andrew III. His only daughter,
Elizabeth, retired to a convent, and the nation
was once more called upon to exercise its ancient
right of electing a king, and three candidates, a
Czech, a German, and an Italian, at once came into
the field. Each of these claimants had a party in the
country, and not until the strength of the nation had
been wasted by internal strife and warfare during a
period of eight years did the Italian party succeed in
placing on the throne Charles Robert, who became
the founder of the Hungarian Anjous. It will be
our task now to relate how the newly elected
ruler, taking the reins of government into his own
hands, introduced into the country the glorious
era of chivalry. Under the reign of the Anjous we
shall see the culture and customs of Western Europe
gradually taking root in Hungarian soil, the name of
Hungary becoming the object of respect and admiration
abroad, the boundaries of the kingdom extended
by a powerful hand, the crown of a brave and
chivalrous neighbor, the Polish nation, placed upon
the brows of the Hungarian king, until, at last, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
the Hungarian poet Bajza sings, “the shores of three
seas formed the frontier walls of the kingdom.”</p>

<p>At first the Czech party was victorious. Wenceslaus,
the aged king of the Czechs, who, through the
female line, was related to the house of Árpád, not
feeling equal to the task of governing Hungary himself,
offered to his party, in his place, his son and
namesake, who was but thirteen years old. On the
27th of August, 1301, at Stuhlweissenburg the sacred
crown of St. Stephen was placed on the head of
young Wenceslaus; but his reign was of short duration.
The curse of the Church of Rome was pronounced
against his partisans, but the citizens of
Buda were little affected by this interdict, and
caused the curse to be hurled back on the anathematizers
by their own prelates. Yet the party of the
boy-king grew so weak that his father deemed it advisable
to recall him home. Wenceslaus the elder
entered Hungary, pillaged the wealthier cathedrals,
and expressed but one wish concerning his son—to
see him for once attired in the royal Hungarian robes.
His adherents complied with the wish of the old
king, and, dressed in the royal robes and bearing the
crown on his head, young Wenceslaus proceeded
homeward, surrounded by his soldiers and under the
protection of armed body-guards.</p>

<p>The Italian party, intent upon avenging this affront,
invaded the territory of the Czechs, and by frightful
massacres made the people atone for the abduction
of the king. The fierce Kuns, or Cumans, throwing
Czech children, strung together by means of holes
bored through the palms of their hands, across their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
saddlebows, wildly tore through the land, devastating
every thing. Very soon Albert, emperor of Germany,
with Otto the Bavarian, came to the rescue of Wenceslaus,
who, grateful for their assistance, delivered
the crown to Otto.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="i174" id="i174">
<img src="images/i_174.png" width="400" height="284" alt="CASTLE OF ÁRVA." />
<span class="caption">CASTLE OF ÁRVA.</span></a></div>

<p>The German party, in their turn, were now victorious,
and obtained possession of the crown of St.
Stephen, the most sacred relic of the nation. Otto
marched into the country, but under the auspices of a
bad omen. The crown was, through some accident,
lost on the road, although his attendants discovered
it afterwards, buried in the mire. Otto, whose vanity
prompted him to display, marched in a procession
through the capital, Buda, adorned with all the
paraphernalia of royalty, and from that day on, every
king succeeding him has, after the coronation, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>peated
this special pageant. Otto was as much the
shadow of a king as Wenceslaus had been before
him. In order to consolidate his power he asked in
marriage the daughter of the most powerful Hungarian
lord, Ladislaus Apor, the <i>vayvode</i> of Transylvania.
Receiving a favorable reply, he hastened,
full of hope, to Transylvania, but on his arrival was
thrown into prison by the wily vayvode. After his
liberation, which took place soon afterward, he turned
his back for ever upon Hungary, and was satisfied
with the empty title of King of Hungary. The
crown, however, remained in the possession of the
vayvode.</p>

<p>The Italian party were now left masters of the
field. The most obstinate and uncontrollable oligarchs
were by this time tired of the disorders prevailing
in the country, and all combined with a
hearty good-will to place Charles Robert, of Anjou,
upon the throne of Árpád. On the 27th of August,
1310, Charles Robert was crowned for the fourth
time, but in this instance with the sacred crown,
which had been at length obtained from Apor.
Charles was now the lawful king (1309-1342), and
could, without interference, set about the task of
restoring order in the country, a work to which he
proved fully equal.</p>

<p>The king had many difficulties in his way. The
ruler <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i> could call but a small portion
of the kingdom really his own. The endless dividing
up of the territory, which was characteristic
of Germany at the close of the last century, was to
be found in miniature also in Hungary. The dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>orders
prevailing under the rule of the last Árpád,
and of the two kings succeeding him, had encouraged
the lawlessness of the marauding nobles.
Every one appropriated as much territory as he
could, and exercised royal or princely authority in
the domains thus acquired by him. While so
many had become the possessors of large estates,
the king was without any personal patrimony.
These little kings had to be reduced, one by one, to
submission, and deprived of the usurped lands. The
most powerful of them was Matthias Csák of Trencsén,
and his subjection gave the greatest trouble, and
consumed the most time.</p>

<p>The power and territory of Matthias Csák extended
from the Northwestern Carpathians to the Theiss and
Danube. The castle of Trencsén was the seat of this
petty king. From this fortified castle on the Vág, built
on a rocky eminence near the commercial road leading
from Silesia to Hungary, he was in the habit of sending
his marauders to devastate the neighboring country.
He pounced like a bird of prey from his rocky
nest upon the unwary merchants who were passing
with their ships below, and the poor traders esteemed
themselves fortunate if they got safely off by leaving
a portion of their wares in the freebooter’s
hands. The plunder thus got together enabled
him to display royal pomp, and such was the dazzling
sumptuousness and luxury exhibited at his castle
that, compared to it, the king’s palace seemed to be
but a poor hut. Csák had his own palatine
treasurer and other officers of high rank, and when
he went about he was attended by an escort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
several thousand armed men. It was only after a
good deal of solicitation that Csák consented to receive
the Pope’s legate, Cardinal Gentilis, and even
then the legate had to meet Csák at the place specified
by the latter, who wished this church dignitary
to understand that he should feel highly honored
by being permitted to shake his hand.</p>

<p>In the beginning, Csák seemed to submit to
Charles, and, swearing fealty to the king, he consented
to be represented at the third coronation. In order
to win Csák’s friendship and support, Charles made
him the <i>Guardian of the Land</i>. But this new
honor did not prevent him from very soon becoming
weary of his subordinate position, and when a law
had been passed ordering the restitution of the
royal castles and domains which had come into the
possession of subjects or strangers, his wish to be independent
became even greater than before. An
armed contest soon ensued between the king and his
powerful subject. It was preceded, however, by a
papal excommunication of Csák and his adherents,
extending even to the dead, but the impious rebel
retorted by laying waste the lands of the neighboring
high prelates. Csák’s power stood at that time
at its height. He was the master of a domain containing
over thirty fortified castles, which, to this
day, is called by the people, after him, Matthias
Land, and it was quite natural that the king was reluctant
to beard the lion in his own den. The
king’s troops first entered the territory of Szepes,
hoping to find there the weak point of the antagonist,
but they were compelled to retreat before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
captains of Csák. The decisive battle took place
in 1312, north of the town of Kassa. The engagement
was sharp and bloody, and terminated in the
defeat of Csák’s men. The ancestors of the
Báthorys, Tökölyis, Drugets, and Széchenyis, who
were amongst the most powerful families in Hungary,
fought on this occasion by the side of the king. Although
humbled, Csák’s power was not greatly impaired,
for we find him, a few years later, strong and
bold enough to attack John, king of Bohemia, and
take from him the fortified castle of Holics.</p>

<p>Charles Robert then turned his attention to his
other rebellious subjects, reducing them to submission,
one by one, leaving Csák to be dealt with by
Providence. He had not, however, to wait very long,
for in 1321 this great lord died. The manner of his
death is described to have been frightful. Worms
generated by his own body consumed him slowly.
There was no one after his death to inherit his vast
estates and with them his great power. Matthias
Land was divided up in smaller sections, and distributed
amongst the king’s favorites. The subjects
of Csák, amongst them his palatine Felician
Zách, submitted at once to the king.</p>

<p>The king’s attention was too much engaged by this
domestic warfare to allow him, while it lasted, to display
the energy which marked the subsequent years
of his reign, an energy which was destined to make
Hungary an influential power in Central Europe.
During these days of civil strife he had his seat in
Temesvár, and his household was so little befitting
royalty that its poverty frequently elicited the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>plaints
of the higher clergy. But matters quietly
changed when Charles transferred his residence to
Visegrád, the royal palace to which cling so many
fond and sad national memories, and which in our
days still, though in ruins, looms up on the right
bank of the Danube as a monument of Hungary’s
ancient power and glory. Charles was full of ambitious
schemes to raise his family to the greatest possible
power, and the extension of the power of
Hungary was deemed by him to be the readiest
means of accomplishing this aim. First of all he
stood in need of money and soldiers, but his genius
enabled him to procure both. He exploited the rich
mines of the country, and raised the commerce and
industry of the realm to a flourishing condition, and
the wealth of the people increased to such an extent
that he felt warranted in levying direct taxes, a
mode of taxation which had before been entirely
unknown in Hungary. The manner in which he
created an army bears witness to his ingenuity.
The county system had become so loose and disorganized
that no soldiers could be expected from
that source. He had to look for them in another
quarter. Charles knew, very well, the chivalrous
disposition of the nation, which, in the matter of
display, had still preserved its Oriental character; he
knew, too, from history, that those who appealed
to the vanity of the Hungarian were never disappointed,
and he laid his plans accordingly. He
transplanted into Hungary one of the graceful institutions
of Western Europe, that of chivalry. Knights
there were in the country, but they were not numer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>ous
and had not proved to be enthusiastic adherents
of the king. Charles understood how to win the affections
of the great lords; he distributed coats-of-arms
and founded orders. In the wide courts of the
castle of Visegrád, knightly tournaments became
frequent, and the new knights, with their fresh heraldic
devices, had an opportunity of meeting each
other in armed combat in the presence of their foreign
king. The king’s court came to be the resort
of noble youths, and boys of noble descent became
the playmates of the royal princes. In order to
rouse the warlike spirit of his great nobles, he allowed
those of them who joined in a campaign with
a certain number of soldiers, to lead their men under
banners bearing their own armorial devices.</p>

<p>An event, however, of most tragic issue, which
has furnished a fruitful theme to Hungarian poets
and artists, almost overthrew the effect of the king’s
wise policy and endangered his life. The scene of
the occurrence, which took place on the 17th of April,
1330, was the magnificent palace of Visegrád. The
former palatine of Csák, Felician Zách, had become
one of the king’s chief councillors, and he,
with his daughter Clara, one of the queen’s maids
of honor, a lady of extraordinary beauty, resided in
the king’s palace. Casimir, the King of Poland, and
the queen’s brother, was at the time a guest at Visegrád,
and during his stay there, behaved improperly
towards Clara Zách. The infuriated father, on
learning this, broke in upon the royal family sitting
in the dining-hall, and intent upon avenging the
affront offered to his daughter, threatened every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
in his way. He fell with sword drawn upon the
royal children and their parents. The children remained
unhurt, but the king was seriously wounded,
and the queen had four of her fingers cut off. John
Cselényi, the queen’s treasurer, finally rushed to the
rescue and felled the exasperated father with his
bronze pole-axe to the ground, and the alarmed servants,
who had meanwhile hastened to the hall, gave
the miserable man, in presence of the royal family,
the <i>coup de grace</i>. A frightful and most cruel punishment
was inflicted, for her father’s bloody act, on
the unhappy Clara and all the members of the Zách
family. The maiden’s ears, nose, lips, and hands
were cut off, and in this condition she was tied, together
with her brother, to a horse’s tail, and dragged
through the land until both died a miserable death.
The Zách family were exterminated to the third
degree, and the remoter kinspeople doomed to slavery.
Such a sentence upon those who had committed
no crime was a most vindictive and savage one, and
the people saw the avenging finger of God in the
results of the unhappy campaign of that year against
the Wallachians. One of the chronicles, referring to
the disastrous issue of the war, says: “The king had
hitherto sailed under favorable signs, and cut, according
to his heart’s desire, through the stormy
waves with the ship of his fortune. But changeable
fortune had now turned her back upon him. His
army had been defeated, and he himself is suffering
tortures from his gouty hands and feet.”</p>

<p>Ban Michael Bazarád, then the ruler of Wallachia,
dared to ignore his dependence on the crown of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Hungary. Charles eagerly seized the opportunity to
punish the traitorous vassal, and hoped, at the same
time, that the indignation of the people against him
for his cruelty would subside at the news of a victorious
campaign against the Wallachians. Declining
the offers of peace made by the repentant ban,
Charles boldly advanced, with his spirited knights,
over the impassable and unfamiliar roads of Wallachia.
He had penetrated so far into the land that
his further advance was rendered impossible by the
absence of any road, and he was determined to retrace
his steps. The Hungarian army was led astray
by the Wallachian guides, and in retreating found
itself quite unexpectedly hemmed in between steep
and towering rocks from which there was no outlet.
A shower of stones descended on their heads; the
Wallachians who occupied the heights sent down
dense volleys of rocks and arrows upon the doomed
Hungarians. Charles himself owed his escape to
the generous devotion of Desiderius Szécsi, one of
his men, with whom he changed dresses. This
brave warrior sealed his devotion with his life. The
enraged Wallachians, mistaking him for the king,
attacked him from every side, and after valiantly
resisting, he finally fell on the battle-field. His sovereign
escaped in safety, and Wallachia maintained
her independence.</p>

<p>Charles, upon his return home, once more busied
himself with the carrying out of his ambitious schemes
for the aggrandizement of his family, and the results
of his efforts gave ample proof of his political
sagacity. He acquired for his family both Naples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
and Poland, although as yet on paper only. Poland
became only under his son Louis the undoubted
possession of the Hungarian king, while Naples
never came under his control. In 1335 Visegrád resounded
incessantly with the din of feasting and
merrymaking; never before nor afterwards were so
many royal guests harbored within its stately walls.
There were Casimir, become King of Poland, the
last descendant of the Piast family; John, the adventurous
King of the Czechs, who subsequently died
the death of a hero on the field of Crécy; his son
Charles, the Margrave of Moravia, and subsequently
Emperor of Germany; three knights of the first class
belonging to the order of German Knights; the
dukes of Saxony and Liegnitz, and numerous church
and lay magnates. The entertainment of so many
distinguished guests constituted a heavy draft on the
royal treasury. A contemporary chronicler states
that “fifteen hundred loaves of bread and one hundred
and eighty flasks of wine were needed daily
for the court of the king of Poland.” Whilst the
guests were feasting, Charles employed all his ingenuity
in shaping the destinies of Eastern Europe.
His negotiations with Casimir, the King of Poland,
resulted in an agreement that Poland should descend,
after his death, to Louis, the son of Charles.
Two years later Charles had the satisfaction of
learning that the Polish nation had confirmed the
private arrangement, and had acknowledged the
right of his son’s succession to the throne of Poland.
One of the finest monuments of Hungarian
mediæval architecture, the cathedral in Kassa,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a><br /><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>owed its completion to this welcome news. Queen
Elizabeth ordered it to be completed in her joy at
the elevation of her son Louis. Charles had also
tried to secure Naples for his son Andrew, by having
him betrothed, at the age of six, to Joanna, the
grand-daughter and heir of the king of Naples. In
July, 1333, the young prince proceeded to Naples to
take possession of his kingdom, as his father thought,
but in reality, as subsequent events proved, to the
place of his destruction. Charles died at a not very
advanced age, having brought most of his plans to a
successful issue in his lifetime.</p>

<span class="caption">CATHEDRAL OF GRAN.</span></a></div>

<p>Six days after his death the crown of Hungary
was placed upon the head of his son Louis, afterwards
surnamed the Great, who was then seventeen
years old (1342-1382). The young king immediately
proceeded on a pilgrimage to the tomb of
St. Ladislaus, the most popular Hungarian king, at
Grosswardein. There at his grave he made a sacred
vow to govern the Hungarian nation after the example
of his great predecessor. From Grosswardein
he proceeded to Transylvania to receive the oath of
fealty of the son of Michael Bazarád. Hardly returned
to his palace at Visegrád, the young king
received depressing news regarding his brother at
Naples. The young Hungarian prince was looked
upon with jealousy by the numerous Italian dukes
at the Neapolitan court, who tried by every means
to hinder his accession to the throne. His mother,
the Hungarian queen, at once hastened, laden with
treasure, to Naples, to rescue her son from the
machinations of his enemies. The Hungarian money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
had its due effect at the papal court, whose vassal
Naples was at that time. Queen Elizabeth obtained
the assurance that her son Andrew would be
crowned, but she returned to Hungary before the
ceremony of coronation had taken place. At her
departure her mind was filled with evil forebodings,
which were but too well justified by coming events.
The queen’s departure was the signal for fresh intrigues
at the Neapolitan court. Philip and Louis
of Taranto, the sons of Catharine of Valois, openly
insulted the young prince. Joanna wickedly turned
from her husband and sided with his enemies. At
length the day of the coronation was approaching.
Andrew, relying on the power he was soon to wield,
warned his enemies that he would avenge the affronts
that had been heaped upon him. His enemies were
seized with terror upon seeing, at the tournament
which took place shortly before the coronation, the
axe and noose depicted beneath the arms of Andrew,
floating on high on his banner. The imminent danger
rendered the intriguing dukes desperate, and
they at once determined to put Andrew out of the
way. His assassination was resolved upon, and,
Joanna giving her assent to the nefarious plan, the
young prince was doomed.</p>

<p>On the 18th of September, 1345, the whole court,
and amongst them Joanna, proceeded to Aversa, to
indulge in the merry pastime of the chase. Andrew
was accompanied by his faithful Hungarian nurse,
Izolda, who, poor creature, little dreamed that her
ward was to be the object of the chase. In the
evening the whole company took up their quarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
at the convent of St. Peter. Andrew had just retired
to his chamber when a familiar voice called him into
the adjoining room, in order to discuss some grave
questions. The unsuspecting youth, anticipating no
evil, left his chamber, but no sooner had he crossed
the threshold when the door was locked behind him
by his secretary. The assassins lying in wait fell
upon their victim at once and strangled him; his
cries for help remaining unheeded. His dead body
they then dragged to the balcony and precipitated it
into the garden below. Whilst this bloody scene
was enacted, Joanna slept soundly, undisturbed by
the scuffle at her door, and cries of distress of her
husband. She afterwards gave the explanation that
she had been put under a spell by a witch.</p>

<p>There was mourning at the castle of Visegrád at
the sad tidings. Louis swore dire vengeance, and
the nation enthusiastically took up arms to support
him. From abroad there arrived but voices of sympathy.
The Italian princes offered his armies free
transit through their territories; Louis, the excommunicated
German Emperor, entered into an alliance
with the king; Edward III., the King of England,
while condoling with him, spurred him on to revenge;
the Pope alone maintained an ominous
silence. This time, however, the desire for revenge
proved stronger with the king than his reverence
for the Pope, and in 1347 the Hungarian army was
ready to march. To punish a faithless woman and
not to conquer Italy was the object of their expedition,
and the Italian princes were glad to afford the
king’s army every facility to reach the proposed goal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<p>All the great lords of the realm rallied round the
king. A large black flag was carried in front of the
Hungarian army and on it was depicted the pale face
of Andrew. On two occasions they were led by the
king against Naples, and each time he was accompanied
by the most distinguished Hungarian families.
Michael Kont, Andrew and Stephen Laczfy, with
Dionysius, the son of the latter, and a host of
others, brought with them their armed trains, by
whose mighty blows both Aversa, of mournful memory,
and proud Naples were soon reduced. Queen
Joanna, with her second husband, Louis of Taranto,
escaped beyond the sea. Louis of Durazzo, one of
the intriguing dukes who was suspected of having
been an accessory to the murder, expiated his crime
by being killed after a gay carouse and thrown down
from the same balcony which had witnessed the
foul deed of the conspirators. Four other dukes
were carried to Hungary as prisoners. King Louis
himself was always foremost in battle and received
grave wounds on more than one occasion. But his
chief desire—to punish Joanna—was not gratified and
at length he entrusted the Pope with the sentence to
be pronounced against her. The Pope, however, declared
her innocent of the crime of murder, imputed
to her, but mulcted her in a fine of 300,000 ducats as
a restitution of the expenditures of the campaign.
The chivalrous king spurned the blood-money and
left the punishment of guilty Joanna to a more upright
judge—to Providence. And Providence dealt
more severely with the queenly culprit than the successor
to St. Peter’s see had done. Charles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Durazzo, called also Charles the Little, son of Louis
of Durazzo, having conquered the throne of Naples,
ordered Queen Joanna in 1382, thirty-seven years
after the commission of her crime, to be thrown into
prison, where she met her death by strangling.</p>

<p>During the Italian campaign Hungary was also
called upon to meet another enemy in the East.
Roving populations were making constant inroads on
the eastern border, harassing the Hungarian inhabitants,
who had by this time become accustomed to
the peaceful avocations of the husbandman and
tradesman. The victorious arms of King Louis
soon put an end to those lawless incursions. But
one of the most beautiful legends of Hungarian
history is connected with one of the campaigns
against these marauding populations. Kieystut, the
Prince of Lithuania, after having been defeated
several years before, broke into Transylvania with
an army considerably swelled by the accession of a
numerous body of Tartars. The king sent Louis
Laczfy, the vayvode of Transylvania, against him,
and the brave Székely people followed in his train.
But the Hungarian army was small and the issue of
the battle remained for a long time doubtful. The
legend tells that the news of the peril threatening
the Hungarian arms reached Grosswardein, where
St. Ladislaus lay buried, and that the heroic saint,
leaving his grave, bestrode the bronze horse of his
own statue, which stood in the centre of the public
square, and hurried off to the relief of his distressed
countrymen. The Tartars were struck with the
apparition of a warrior “who towered over them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
head and shoulders,” and above whom was visible
the holy Virgin Mary, the patroness of Hungary.
The pagans were seized with terror at this sight,
and the battle ended in a brilliant victory for the
Hungarians.</p>

<p>The arms of the king were no less successful in
Servia where he was about “to kindle the light of
faith.” But the most glorious of his wars was the
one carried on against proud Venice, which continued
during the greater portion of his reign. Her
enemies, especially Genoa, willingly sided with the
king of Hungary, and the ultimate result was the
utter humiliation of the city of St. Mark. At last,
in 1381, one year before the king’s death, peace was
concluded between the two belligerents, a peace of
which the Hungarians had every reason to be proud,
for by its terms Dalmatia was unconditionally annexed
to Hungary, and Venice herself had to send the Hungarian
king, annually on St. Stephen’s Day, the 20th
of August, a tribute of 7,000 ducats. As an indication
of the high esteem in which the name of Hungary was
held at that time, it is interesting to learn that foreign
rulers sent their children to the Hungarian
court to be educated, and the inference is not a
strained one that the court of Louis must have been
a centre of the European culture and refinement of
that day. The spouse selected by the king,
Elizabeth, the daughter of Stephen, the Prince of
Bosnia, had herself been sent to the court to be
trained in courtly accomplishments. At the Hungarian
court also, Charles IV., the Emperor of Germany,
wooed Anna, the Duchess of Schweidnitz, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
future empress. These two rulers were united by
ties of close friendship, until the discontent of the
Germans with “the stepfather of their country,” as
they called Charles IV., ripened a scheme to transfer
the German crown to the Hungarian king. Although
King Louis refused to accept the crown proffered to
him, the sting remained, and his imperial friend became
his deadly enemy. The emperor persisted
in indulging in his unfounded suspicions of the
king’s good faith, and so far forgot himself as to
speak insultingly of the king and his exalted mother.
The Hungarian ambassadors at the emperor’s court,
incensed at the affront done to their master, challenged
the emperor to mortal combat. But he
cravenly declined to accept the challenge, whereupon
they declared war in the name of their king.
Louis, who almost worshipped his mother, approved
of the proceedings of his ambassadors, and sent the
emperor an insulting letter, in which he declared that
nothing better might be expected from a drunkard.
Very soon a large army of Kuns devastated Moravia,
until, at length, after a warfare of several years, the
humiliated emperor begged for peace, obtaining the
Pope’s intercession in his behalf. Peace was at last
concluded, and matrimonial alliances were to make
it doubly sure. Sigismund, the emperor’s son, was
betrothed to Mary, the king’s daughter.</p>

<p>In the latter half of the fourteenth century Christianity
in Europe was threatened by a new foe. The
warlike followers of Osman had, by the capture of
Adrianople firmly laid the foundations of their powerful
empire in Europe. Youths, forcibly taken at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
tender age from their Christian parents, and educated
afterwards in implicit obedience to the behests of
the Sultan, were rigorously trained as soldiers after
the most approved fashion of the day, and the troops
thus obtained were destined to become the most
formidable aid in the building of the Ottoman power
in Europe. The Eastern empire had sunk too low, at
that time, to be able, single-handed, to resist such a
power, and she lost her strongholds, one after the
other. In this strait her ruler resorted to one of
those deceitful devices characterizing the policy of
the Eastern court. John Palæologos, the Eastern emperor,
proceeded to the court of the king of Hungary,
at Buda, and, promising to give in his adhesion
to the Western Church, he asked the aid of Louis
against the savage enemy. The “Banner-bearer of
the Church,” as the king of Hungary was styled by
the Pope, deemed it his duty, under these circumstances,
to come to the rescue of the distressed
emperor, and shortly afterwards the two kindred
nations, the Turks and the Hungarians, met in hostile
array on the banks of the Maritza. This was the
first warlike contest of the two nations. It resulted
in the victory of 20,000 Hungarians over a Turkish
army four times as large, a victory commemorated
to this day by the treasures and appropriate inscriptions
still to be seen at the church of Mariazell in
Styria.</p>

<p>Casimir, the last Polish king of the house of Piast,
died on the 5th of November, 1370. His death
was caused by an injury contracted in falling from
his horse during the chase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>On the 17th of the same month Louis was
crowned King of Poland, at Cracow, by the Archbishop
of Gnesen. At the very moment when he
was about to reach the goal of the highest ambition
of his predecessor, and of himself, Louis seemed to
waver, and to doubt the expediency of accepting the
crown. He could not help reflecting that governing
two nations, which were united by no other tie except
his own person, and defending them against
their enemies, might prove a task to which one king
was not equal. He nevertheless accepted the crown,
but his sinister presentiments were fated speedily to
be confirmed. The Polish lords were not used to an
energetic rule. The nobles of Little and Great
Poland were eager, each for themselves, to secure
the offices of state, but both equally hated the queen-mother
sent there to rule. The country soon fell
a prey to internal dissensions and strife, compelling
the queen to fly from the land, in which a new
pretender had appeared. This pretender to the
throne was a kinsman of the late king of Poland,
and had retired to a convent in France in the lifetime
of Casimir. His ambition made him exchange
the cassock for armor, and a large portion of the
people of Poland very soon acknowledged him to be
their king. But his royalty was of short duration;
the army of the adventurer was scattered by the adherents
of King Louis.</p>

<p>The Lithuanians, whom we have before mentioned
as being driven back by Andrew Laczfy, now took
advantage of the disorders prevailing in Poland, and
succeeded in securing such a foothold in that coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a><br /><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>try
that one of their dukes, Jagello, who was converted
to Christianity, and subsequently married
Hedvig, the daughter of King Louis, became in the
course of a few years the founder of a new Polish
dynasty, the Jagellons, a dynasty of mournful memory
in the history of Hungary.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="i194" id="i194">
<img src="images/i_194.png" width="500" height="306" alt="CASTLE OF BETZKÓ." />
<span class="caption">CASTLE OF BETZKÓ.</span></a></div>

<p>The last days of Louis were embittered by the
disorders in Poland. He who had succeeded everywhere
else failed there. Disappointment shortened
his life; upon returning to Tyrnau on the 11th
of September, 1382, from attending the Polish
diet convened in Hungary, he was taken ill, and
breathed there his last. The Hungarian nation lost
in him one of their greatest kings. His reign was
stormy but glorious. The Hungarian banner floated
always victoriously on his numerous battlefields,
and he humbled the enemies of the nation. In spite
of his many wars, Louis found leisure to devote his
time to the cultivation of the arts of peace. He gave
laws to his country, which secured her permanence,
and remained in force up to the most recent ages.
He brought order into the affairs of the Church, and
into the administration of justice. He was a zealous
patron of learning, and established a university
at Fünfkirchen (Pécs). His court, the seat of which
he fixed at Buda, was brilliant; the Western customs,
brought over from Italy, prevailing there. In times
of peace magnificent tilts and tournaments at home
took the place of the bloody game of war abroad,
and the distribution of arms and knightly distinctions
introduced by his father continued during his
reign on even a larger scale. On all occasions Louis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
showed himself to be a brave, wise, and pious king,
whose long rule is described by an eminent Hungarian
historian as proving “a continued blessing”
for his nation.</p>

<p>Dark days succeeded the glorious reign of Louis.
The Hungarian nation was eager to testify their
gratitude to their great king by a concession made
to his dynasty—notwithstanding its foreign origin,—which
they had refused to make to the glorious dynasty
of the native Árpád family. After the king’s
death his daughter Mary was proclaimed queen and
the crown conferred upon her. But the crown
brought little joy to Mary, for the festivities of
the coronation were hardly finished when she was
menaced by dangers coming from two sides. The
Poles hated Sigismund, to whom Mary was affianced,
and insisted also that their ruler should live amongst
them. Elizabeth, the queen-mother, in order to conciliate
the opposition of the Poles, and not to risk
the loss of Poland, offered them, as a substitute for
Mary, her younger daughter Hedvig. The Poles
agreed to this compromise, upon the condition that
they should select a husband for Hedvig, their queen.
It was a great trial for Hedvig to part from William,
Duke of Austria, to whom she was betrothed, but her
choice lay between him and the crown of Poland.
The allurements of the latter prevailed, and in February,
1386, the Polish nation celebrated the nuptials
of their queen with the Lithuanian duke, Jagello, recently
converted to Christianity, whom they had
chosen for her husband. This marriage put an end
to the union of the two countries, and Poland had
once more a ruler of her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>There was greater danger threatening Hungary
from the south. The nobles of Croatia were dissatisfied
with female rule. There were some ambitious
men who were incensed to see themselves excluded
from the royal court, whilst a man of low descent,
like Garay, the palatine, took the lead there. They
were intent upon destroying the government in
order to remove the queen. In Charles of Durazzo,
who owed the throne of Naples to Louis the
Great, they found a man who was willing to become
a candidate for the throne of Hungary. The traitors,
however, on the appearance in their midst of the
energetic Garay, accompanied by the queen and the
queen-mother Elizabeth, kept quiet for a while.
But no sooner had the royal party left Croatia, when
these men, who all owed their honors to the favor of
the late king, resumed their machinations, and prevailed
upon Charles of Durazzo to perjure himself
and to break the oath he had pledged to the late
king not to disturb his daughter Mary in the possession
of her throne. In 1385, undeterred by the
warnings of his wife, he arrived in Croatia.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the marriage of Mary and Sigismund
had taken place. The latter, in order to collect an
army with which he should be enabled to oppose the
advancing enemy and defend the rights of his royal
spouse, hypothecated a portion of the country to
raise the necessary funds. This ill-timed transaction
increased the chances of his opponent, for the nation
saw with indignation that Sigismund, in the
capacity of “the guardian of the realm” only, without
possessing any royal rights, began his guardian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>ship
by thus disposing of Hungarian territory. Such
a disgraceful transaction was unknown in the history
of the country, and it was not long before Charles
could enter Buda, without let or hindrance; disguising,
however, even then, his lawless aspirations,
by pretending to have only come to make peace between
the nation and her queen. But Charles was
not long in showing his true designs. On the 31st of
December, 1385, the cathedral of Stuhlweissenburg
witnessed a most moving scene. The coronation of
the usurper Charles was to be solemnized; the
church was crowded, to its remotest corner, with
sumptuously dressed lords. The widowed queen
and her daughter Mary were also in attendance.
The customary question was asked of the magnates
of the land, by the Primate of Hungary, whether
they wished Charles to be their king. The enthusiastic
acclamations of assent became, at the Primate’s
third appeal, feebler and feebler as the piteous
sobs of the two queens, who had sunk upon their
father’s and husband’s grave, resounded in the
church. The coronation proceeded nevertheless,
and whilst the archbishop sent up his prayers of
grace to heaven, the widowed queen was silently
vowing desperate vengeance at the grave of her
husband. Bad omens followed the pageant; during
the solemn procession the banner of St. Stephen
split into pieces, and as the new king entered the
gates of his palace at Buda, its walls were shaken to
its very foundations by a tremendous thunder-storm.
Charles had occupied the throne thirty-nine days
only, when he was summoned by the widowed queen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
residing under one roof with him, into her presence
to settle some grave matters of state. The king
obeyed the summons, and was humbly received by
Garay the palatine, Blasius Forgách the lord cup-bearer,
Thomas Szent-Györgyi, the ban of Croatia,
and the other lords present. The council had hardly
commenced when, at a hint from the palatine, Forgách
got behind the king and struck him on the
head with his pole-axe. The blow inflicted a mortal
wound and the king fainted away. The assassins
had made careful preparations for the bloody event.
Whilst Forgách was doing away with the king in the
council-chamber, his Italian soldiers, in the palace,
were disarmed by Garay’s men. Charles was taken
to Visegrád, where he was thrown into prison and
afterwards strangled.</p>

<p>The news of the king’s assassination stirred up
fresh discontents in Croatia, where his party had
been most numerous. Garay imagined he could
quell the rebellion again by appearing amongst
them. The two queens approved of his scheme,
and proceeded, in his company, to Croatia. This
time, however, their going to Croatia was to prove
fatal to them. The queens, travelling with a small
escort, were surprised by John Horváthy, one of the
rebels, near Diákovár, and a mortal struggle ensued
between the rebels and the queen’s escort. Garay
and Forgách fought with exasperation in defence of
the queens. Garay, pierced by arrows, set his back
against the coach, valiantly selling his life, and not
allowing the enemy to approach his royal charges
except across his dead body. All this heroism was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
wasted in the face of the overpowering number of
the rebels, and the dreadful spectacle was soon presented
to the queens of having the heads of their
faithful defenders cut off before their very eyes.
The queens themselves were placed in confinement
at Novigrad, on the sea-shore. The long series of
deaths by violence, which appeared to persecute the
Anjou race like a curse, was destined to have one
more added to it at Novigrad. The widow of Louis
the Great was, after a short imprisonment, strangled
by one of the rebels before the eyes of her unfortunate
daughter.</p>

<p>The disorders had now reached their climax; one
of the crowned rulers of Hungary, Charles, had been
assassinated, the other, Mary, was a prisoner at
Diákovár. The rebels were preparing to bring the
son of the usurper Charles into the country, while
another party had cast their eyes upon Ladislaus
Jagello, the husband of Hedvig, as an available
aspirant to royal honors. The Prince of Servia was
arming to attack Hungary from the south, and
Poland was preparing to invade the country from
the northeast, whilst the princes of Wallachia and
Moldavia, vassals of Hungary, declared their independence.
So many disasters demanded a prompt
remedy, and the nation, in their distress, decided to
accept as their ruler Sigismund, the queen’s husband.
He was acknowledged as king, and the crown of St.
Stephen was placed on his head by Benedek, the
bishop of Veszprém, in March, 1387, and his reign
lasted until 1437. To these melancholy circumstances
did Sigismund, of the house of Luxemburg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
owe his elevation to the throne of Hungary. It was
a heavy burden that he had taken upon his shoulders,
the task of bringing order into the affairs of
the distracted country. His first and foremost duty
was to liberate his august wife from her imprisonment,
but it must be reluctantly admitted that he
exhibited little zeal in the accomplishment of this.
While he was travelling leisurely from place to place
without seemingly heeding the danger of delay,
Venice came to the rescue. The statesmen of the
city of St. Mark had watched with jealousy the
union of Naples and Hungary in the hands of one
ruler, and to obviate this danger to their own city,
they sought the friendship of Sigismund, and sent
vessels of war against his rebellious subjects. John
Palisna, in whose charge the imprisoned queen had
been placed, readily delivered her up to John Barbadico,
the captain of the republic, stipulating only for
himself the right of leaving without molestation. In
July, 1388, husband and wife met near Agram (Zágráb),
and Sigismund made up for his former laxity
by sumptuously rewarding the Venetians who had
liberated his queen.</p>

<p>The newly elected king had on the very threshold
of his reign a twofold difficulty to face. He had to
quell the rebellion, which in the southern part of his
dominions was still active, and to arrest the encroachments
of the Turkish power. He succeeded
in putting down the rebellion. He marched into
Croatia and Bosnia, pursuing the rebels to their
mountain fastnesses, and after many years of varying
fortunes of war he reduced them to obedience. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
survivors of the scattered rebels sought refuge in the
wild forests of Syrmia. A small band of thirty men
rallied round Stephen Kont of Hédervár, the son of
the famous palatine Michael, a man noted for his
bravery. Sigismund charged Vajdafy, one of his
trusty men, with the reduction of this band. He
found it, however, impossible to get near them, and
finally resorted to a stratagem. Vajdafy promised
them a free pardon from Sigismund if they surrendered
and came up to Buda with him. The
thirty-one warriors accepted this proposal, but on
their way the treacherous Vajdafy ordered them to
be placed in chains. They were so incensed at this
disgraceful treatment, that they determined not to do
homage to the king when brought into his presence.
They refused to bend their knees before him. The
king did not reflect long, but ordered the thirty-one
gallants to be taken to St. George’s Place in Buda,
where they met their death at the hands of the executioner.
Kont was the last to lay his head on the
block. His faithful page Csóka burst into tears at
the bloody sight. Sigismund comforted the youth,
telling him he would be a better master to him than
Kont was. “I shall never serve thee, Czech hog,”
was the boy’s reply, a reply which cost him his life,
for he was immediately executed. This barbarous
and illegal act of the king would no doubt have provoked,
in ordinary times, a rebellion in the country,
but the general attention was just then absorbed by
the encroachments of the Turks.</p>

<p>Servia had already become a vassal state of the
Turks, and was compelled to swell with her army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
the power of the mightiest foe to Christianity. The
last victory won by the Servians over the Turks was
in 1387, when they mowed down two thirds of the
Turkish army, numbering 20,000 men. Sultan Murad
invaded Servia in 1389 to avenge the disgrace of
defeat. He was met in June by Lazarus, the last
independent Prince of Servia, on the Kosovo (blackbird)
field, called in Hungarian the Rigómezö. The
engagement was a bloody one, and disastrous to the
rulers on both sides. Sultan Murad received his
death wound from the dagger of a Servian soldier,
whilst Prince Lazarus was delivered by his own son-in-law,
Vuk Brankovitch, into the hands of the Turks
and into the jaws of certain death. With Lazarus
was lost the independence of Servia, and his scattered
army fled in dismay from the ill-fated battle-field.
This victory had brought the Turks one step
nearer to the borders of Hungary, and added further
to the fear of their victorious arms in that Bajazet,
the successor of Murad, surnamed the “Lightning,”
was known to be eager for new conquests. Two
years after the battle of Kosovo we find the Turks
already on Hungarian soil. Sigismund tried, at first,
negotiations. Viddin, Nicopolis, and Silistria, which
belonged to Hungary under Louis the Great, had
recently fallen into the hands of the Turks. Sigismund
sent an embassy to Bajazet calling upon him
to surrender these cities to their rightful owner.
The sultan received the embassy at Brussa, and, conducting
them into a hall ornamented with arms and
weapons of every description, he pointed at these,
saying: “Go back and tell your king that, as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
see for yourself, I have a good enough title to these
lands.” Sigismund rightly understood this to be a
declaration of war. He at once summoned the
chivalry of Europe to take part in a crusade against
the infidels, and entered into an alliance with Manuel
II., the Emperor of the East. Many knights from
England, France, and Italy responded to the call.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mary, the wife of Sigismund, died in
1395. It was to her that Sigismund owed his throne,
and now that she was no more, there was nothing to
keep up the ties of affection between the people and
their restless and inconstant king. Sigismund hoped
to dazzle the nation by the glory of a successful war.
In 1396 he marched the assembled crusaders to
Nicopolis against the Turks. The king, surrounded
by the chief captains of the army, was merrily feasting
when the news was brought that Bajazet, the “Lightning,”
was approaching. Both armies were eager for
the contest. The French knights, in spite of Sigismund’s
protests, claimed the privilege of the first
attack. Ignorant of the Turkish system of fighting,
which consisted in sending the weakest and least-disciplined
troops to the fore, to bear the brunt of
the first attack, the French rushed with their united
strength upon the enemy. The attack, as usual, was
favorable to the French arms, but hardly had they
dispersed the inferior troops when they found themselves
face to face with the serried ranks of the Spahis
and Janissaries. The hot-blooded Frenchmen were
no match for these incomparable soldiers, and a large
portion of them fell on the battle-field while the remainder
were taken prisoners. This discomfiture had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
a depressing effect on the other crusaders, and their
army scattered in disorderly flight. Sigismund, himself,
escaped only with great difficulty, and took
refuge on a ship on the Danube which brought him
to Constantinople.</p>

<p>This unlucky campaign proved a fresh source of
trouble to the country, for the king, keenly feeling
the disgrace of his defeat, stayed away from Hungary
for over half a year. The southern part of
Hungary was again in rebellion and many, believing
in the false report of the king’s death, were desirous
of proceeding to the election of a successor. The
king, apprehensive of losing his throne, came back
and, in his own fashion, rewarded his friends and
punished his opponents.</p>

<p>In order to add to the number of his adherents he
distributed amongst them, in defiance of an ancient
law, the crown-lands. He filled the highest positions
in the state with foreigners. This was more than
the Hungarian lords would submit to, especially
after the disgraceful defeat the king had just suffered
on the battle-field. The impatient magnates, weary
of his inglorious rule, entered upon a conspiracy to
overthrow the king. On the 28th of April, 1401, a
number of the great lords of the land assembled at
Buda and requested the attendance of the king,
in order to take counsel on affairs of state. The
Garays, the unflinching adherents of the king, knew
what was going to happen, but did not dare to
divulge or oppose the plans of the conspirators.
Sigismund appeared among the assembled magnates,
but only to find out, too late, that he was, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
fact, their prisoner. He was taken to Visegrád and
confined in its castle. Another king had now to be
elected. Three claimants were on the field—Ladislaus
Jagello, William of Austria, and Ladislaus,
the son of Charles the Little. It was fortunate,
however, for the king that no election could be
agreed upon; and, while the magnates were taking
counsel with each other, the Garays succeeded in
liberating the king and took him to Siklós, one of
their own fortified castles. His followers, meanwhile,
took up arms in his cause and succeeded in
placing him again on the throne, after he had been
a prisoner for four months. But before doing so
they obtained his promise not to punish or molest
the conspirators. Michael Garay was generously rewarded
for his exertions on behalf of Sigismund; he
received annually a pension of one thousand ducats,
and was appointed to the dignity of a palatine. The
severe lesson was of benefit to the king. He appeared
totally changed after his experience in prison.
He faithfully kept the promise he had given, and
did not molest the rebellious lords, but rather sought
their friendship, and, making union with them, seriously
endeavored by legal means to improve the
government of the country.</p>

<p>He had hardly seized the reins of government
with firm hands, when the cry of battle called him
again away. Having no son, Sigismund tried to
secure the throne for his daughter Elizabeth. She
was affianced to Albert of Austria, and the king prevailed
upon one hundred and ten lords to sign a
document by which his daughter’s husband would,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
after the king’s demise, become entitled to wear the
crown of St. Stephen. The Neapolitan party was
roused into rebellion by this arrangement, and Ladislaus
of Naples penetrated into the interior of the
country. The primate of the realm, the archbishop
of Gran, sided with the rebels and placed the crown
of Hungary upon the head of the invading foreigner.
Sigismund, who was just then amongst the
Czechs, whose crown he coveted, hastened home upon
learning the peril with which he was menaced. The
followers of Ladislaus were soon put down, and,
being assured of the king’s pardon, they all gave in
their submission. Ladislaus, fearful lest the fate of
his father, Charles the Little, should overtake him,
left the country, and henceforth dared not to question
the right of Sigismund to the crown. In the
course of the years that followed some wise measures
were introduced concerning the privileges and franchises
of the cities, and regulating the relations of
the Church of Hungary to the Vatican. The Pope
having been the most zealous partisan of Ladislaus
of Naples, a law was enacted putting an end to the
Pope’s right of interference in the affairs of the
Hungarian Church.</p>

<p>The king formed again new marriage ties, and
took Barbara, the daughter of Count Arminius
Cilley, the powerful lord of the Styrian castle of
Cilli, for his wife. The new queen added but little
to his happiness. The king established the order
of the dragon in commemoration of his wedding.
The insignia of the order were a red cross with a
gold dragon who twisted his tail in a circular shape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
around his own neck. The membership was confined
to twenty-four, who bound themselves to defend the
Christian faith against the Turks. The king and
queen were the first members of the order, the remaining
members were selected from among the
highest dignitaries of the land. A high distinction
fell to the lot of the king of Hungary on the 20th of
September, 1410. Ruprecht, who had been elevated
to the imperial throne of Germany, after the deposition
of Wenceslaus the drunkard (the half insane
brother of Sigismund), was now dead. Wenceslaus
was now striving to regain the lost dignity, but in this
he was opposed by his own brother Sigismund. The
electoral princes voted for the latter. This was the
first time that a similar distinction had been conferred
upon the wearer of the crown of St. Stephen.
The nation felt proud of the exaltation of their king,
but the nation as well as the king found subsequently
ample reason to regret their premature rejoicing. Indeed
the fears of St. Ladislaus and Louis the Great,
who had declined the imperial crown lest they might,
accepting it, be caused to neglect the affairs of Hungary,
proved but too well founded. The business of
the emperor required his presence elsewhere, and
while he was absent for years from the country,
matters at home visibly went to rack and ruin.
The emperor-king could not spare time to attend
to the most important duty of his reign, the driving
back of the Turks, and, there can be no doubt, that
it was owing less to the civil wars of that period
than the lukewarmness of Sigismund in the face of
the Ottoman advances during the last years of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
reign, that it became possible for the Moslem power
to obtain possession, a century later, of the stronghold
of Christianity. The signs of the coming life-and-death
struggle became already apparent—and
once the struggle begun there was no way to destroy
the Ottoman power, nor could a favorable
opportunity, once missed, return again.</p>

<p>The fortunes of war were once more propitious to
the Hungarians—in their war against Venice—but for
several years afterwards history records nothing but
a long series of uninterrupted disasters. The war
with Venice was carried on to get possession of
the littoral islands and cities. Venice was shamefully
beaten, and the peace-suing ambassadors of
the proud city of St. Mark had to undergo the
humiliation of seeing before their very eyes nineteen
of their flags torn to pieces in the streets of
Buda. But the new banners of Venice were soon
destined to be victoriously planted on the Hungarian
littoral territory, and Sigismund was compelled
to sign a peace by which the nation lost her seacoast
possessions. And while the power of Venice
was curtailing the country in the south, the richest
towns in the north were being lost through the recklessness
of Sigismund. In order to extricate himself
from financial embarrassments he hypothecated to
Ladislaus, the king of Poland, thirteen of the
wealthiest cities of the Szepes country, which was
largely settled by German merchants and tradesmen.
These places remained hypothecated until the first
partition of Poland, 1772, when Hungary was reinstated
in the full possession of the mortgaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
towns. After arranging these affairs the king went
abroad, where he remained for six years. During
his absence the country, owing to the despotic rule
of Barbara, his queen, became a prey to disorder.
It would cover pages unprofitably to give a detailed
account of the private affairs of the wanton queen,
and, passing over these, we shall accompany her
royal husband on his journey to the Council of
Constance.</p>

<p>The condition of the Church of Rome was at that
period a most lamentable one. The question of reforms
within the Church became from day to day
more pressing. Wycliffe, the Englishman, had the
boldness to assume the rôle of a heretic. John
Huss, the rector of the university of Prague, soon
became a zealous propagator of his teachings. The
majority of the inhabitants of Bohemia embraced
the new tenets, assuming, after their leader, the
name of “Hussites.” One of the chief objects of
the Council of Constance—1414-1418—was to extirpate
heresy, and to exterminate its votaries.
Numerous ecclesiastical and lay lords gathered at
Constance to advise together under the guidance of
the emperor-king, who presided. The attending
Hungarian magnates deemed it due to their fame
and dignity to indulge in the most extravagant
luxury. The emperor-king felt constrained to eclipse
his subjects in sumptuous display on such an occasion,
and, in order to accomplish this, he had to sell
Brandenburg to Frederick of Hohenzollern, and
there can be no doubt that through this sale he unwittingly
contributed to the future greatness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
present imperial dynasty in Germany. We will not
attempt to describe here the Council of Constance,
but need only mention that it was the treachery
and bad faith of Sigismund which caused the tragic
end and martyrdom of John Huss. His disciples
vowed vengeance, and Hungary, of all the dominions
of the emperor-king, was, during many years, most
exposed to their cruel devastations.</p>

<p>After an absence of six years, during which Sigismund
had visited Germany, France, Italy, and England,
he at length returned to Hungary. He found
the country unsettled, and menaced on two sides
by powerful enemies. Having sent his wife, the
cause of the internal disorders, to prison, he led an
army against the Turks, who were threatening the
southern portion of the country. Before describing
the events of that campaign let us cast a rapid
glance at the condition of the Moslem world in
Europe. A dreadful blow had fallen on the Ottoman
empire in July, 1402. Timur, the Central-Asian
conqueror, destroyed the Turkish army near
Angora, and captured the person of the redoubtable
Bajazet himself. The impaired power of the Ottoman
empire was still more weakened by the internecine
strife between Bajazet’s sons. Mohammed I.
emerged at last as the victorious sultan, and in his
person the warlike qualities of his ancestors reappeared
once more on the throne of the Osmanlis.
The rulers of Servia and Moldavia very soon acknowledged
his sovereignty. Hervoja, the Bosnian
<i>boyar</i>, followed their example. The three captains
of Sigismund, John Maróty, John Garay, and Paul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Csupor, marched against the latter. The engagement
resulted in the victory of Hervoja. Csupor
was taken prisoner, while his fellow-captains sought
safety in an ignominious flight. Csupor, years ago,
had scoffingly greeted Hervoja, when at the Hungarian
court, by bellowing like an ox, and the victor,
now remembering the affront put upon him, revenged
himself by having the ill-fated captain sewn into an
ox’s skin, and telling him: “Now thou canst bellow
as much as thou likest; thou hast also the shape of
an ox.” He caused him to be thrown into the water,
where he was drowned.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Stephen Lazarevitch, the Prince of
Servia, became weary of the Turkish alliance, and
with a view to securing to his nephew, George
Brankovitch, the succession in Servia, he sought the
aid of Sigismund, offering to surrender to him several
important fortified places along the Danube for his
services. The Prince of Servia died in 1428, and
Sigismund claimed the possession of the places
promised to him. The Servian commander of
Galambócz, one of the strongest of these fortresses,
however, treacherously allowed it to pass into the
hands of the Turks. It was to re-possess himself of
this fortress, which he could not permit to remain in
Moslem hands, that Sigismund marched against the
enemy. He had nearly succeeded in capturing it,
when news reached him that Sultan Murad II. was
approaching. Sigismund did not dare to engage in
battle with such overpowering numbers, and having
stipulated for himself and his army free passage, he
pusillanimously gave up the siege. Yet the Hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>garians
were just beginning to cross the Danube,
when the Turks, breaking faith, attacked them.
Sigismund himself was in great danger, and he owed
his escape only to the heroism of Cecilia Rozgonyi,
the wife of the captain-in-chief, who facilitated his
flight in a galley steered by herself. This was
Sigismund’s last armed encounter with the Turks,
and its issue did by no means add to his laurels.</p>

<p>The remaining years of Sigismund’s reign were
taken up with the organization of the defences of the
country and with continual warfare against the
Czech Hussites in the north. Wenceslaus, the king
of Bohemia, died in 1419, and Sigismund endeavored
to obtain his brother’s crown. The Czechs hated
the executioner of their beloved spiritual teacher,
and conceded to Sigismund the Bohemian crown
only after a hard and protracted struggle. Hungary
had to suffer for the ambition of her king, for, during
these struggles, the exasperated Czechs, on more
than one occasion, laid waste her territories in the
north-west. Sigismund, however, did not allow himself
to be deterred from pursuing his aim. Acting
upon the principle of <i>divide et regna</i>, he very sensibly
conciliated a portion of the Czechs by granting them
religious reforms, and whilst the people were desperately
fighting among themselves he succeeded in
securing the crown of Bohemia.</p>

<p>Sigismund may be said to have reached the goal
of all his wishes. He united on his head the crowns
of imperial Germany, Hungary, and Bohemia. Yet, on
the whole, he was not a happy man. His wife Barbara
had regained her freedom and was embittering
the last days of the sickly monarch. This ambitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
woman coveted the crown of Hungary, and in order
to obtain it she was scheming, first of all, to hinder
the succession of Albert, the son-in-law of the emperor-king.
With this view she entered into negotiations
with Ladislaus III., the king of Poland, the
purport of which was that he should marry her
after Sigismund’s demise, and thus unite the dominions
of the king of Hungary with Poland. The
arrangement was nearly concluded when these intrigues
were discovered by Sigismund. He deprived
his wife once more of her liberty, and hastened from
Bohemia to Hungary to prevail upon the Estates to
accept Albert’s succession, and then to turn his steps
towards Transylvania to put down the rebellion that
had broken out there. The peasantry of Transylvania,
having a leaning towards the teachings of
Huss, were exposed to constant persecutions. They
were also oppressed by burdensome taxes, and finally,
goaded on by their unhappy condition, they rose in
arms against their tyrants. The massacred nobility
and burning villages bore witness to the exasperation
of the peasantry. Fate prevented Sigismund from
either meeting the estates or quelling the Transylvanian
rising. He was overtaken by death at Znaym,
in Moravia, in December, 1437. His dead body and
the captive queen arrived in Hungary one week later.
His remains were conveyed from Presburg to Grosswardein
to be placed there by the side of his first
wife, Mary, and at the feet of St. Ladislaus. It is
rather saddening to reflect that, after a reign of fifty
years, his funeral procession should have been lighted
by the glare from the burning villages of Transylvania,
set on fire by her own peasantry.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br /><br />

<small>JOHN HUNYADI (HUNIADES), THE GREAT CHAMPION
OF CHRISTIANITY.<br /><br />

1456.</small></h2>

<p>Very little, if any thing, is known of the father of
John Hunyadi, or of the pedigree of his family; indeed,
the very circumstances of his birth are shrouded
in dim legendary light, and yet he looms up all at
once in the proud position of governor of Hungary,
the adored idol of his country, and the admiration
of all Christian Europe. It was owing to his exertions
that his family became great, rich, and powerful,
but, at the same time, he guarded Hungary
against the evils of domestic war, and saved her
from Moslem rule. He served his country in the
capacity of a brave soldier, an eminent general, and
a cautious and energetic statesman, lending her the
aid of his strong arm, his undaunted courage, and
his clear understanding.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="i216" id="i216">
<img src="images/i_216.png" width="400" height="326" alt="HUNYAD CASTLE." />
<span class="caption">HUNYAD CASTLE.</span></a></div>

<p>In his time, during the fifteenth century, through
all Europe, and especially in Hungary, that man
was most respected who had earned the repute of a
distinguished soldier. If any one wished to become
conspicuous amongst his countrymen he had to be,
first of all, an able general and a military hero. Ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>cording
to the views of that day, only he was looked
upon as a true man who was a free man, or, in the
nomenclature of that period, a noble man, but every
noble was a born soldier, and soldiering was both his
duty and privilege. Martial merit was recognized
as the only real merit, and military service as the
only honorable occupation. By this means every
man had the chance of becoming the possessor of
land, and of acquiring nobility, for bravery was rewarded
by the king with a grant of lands, and with
the rank of a noble. As a consequence wars were
longed for by many. The common man (or as he
was then styled, the bondman) hoped to acquire
land and to be created a noble, the noble to add to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
his landed estate, and to rise in rank. The more
land a noble owned, and the greater the number of
his bondmen, the larger the number of the soldiers
he was able to equip, and the greater the military
power wielded by him, the better his prospects of
promotion to a higher position in the state, in society,
and about the person of his king. The first
games of childhood were martial games, and the
first tasks of youth were military tasks.</p>

<p>Such, no doubt, had also been the early training
of John Hunyadi; by such means he rose, acquired
a large fortune, and was able to support a great
army. In truth, however, there is no information
whatever extant as to his early education, for when
he first entered upon the stage of war, in 1437, he
was already an accomplished general. In this year
the Turkish sultan, who was constantly attacking,
harassing, and laying waste the vassal states of Hungary,
Bosnia, Servia, Wallachia, and Bulgaria, turned
his arms against Servia. The general of the Hungarian
king met the enemy near the fortress of
Semendria, where the decisive battle was to be fought.
During this engagement a knight with a coat of
arms, familiar to no one, made his appearance. A
black raven, holding a gold ring in his beak, was
painted on his shield. Never before had they witnessed
fighting as gallant as that of the Raven
Knight at the head of his small troop. He was
seen now in one place, now in another, but wherever
he showed himself the enemy either fled before him
or was slain. To the Hungarians it seemed as if the
god of war himself had descended to fight under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
their banners, and they were seized with wild enthusiasm.
The Turkish general, with the remnant of
his army, fled in dismay, and from this day forward
the name of the raven knight continued to be the
terror of Turkish warriors. This mysterious knight
was John Hunyadi. To be sure, men like Pongrácz,
Szentmiklóssy, Thalloczy, or Maróthy, had before
this day proved themselves heroes in the many
struggles against the Turks. After this memorable
battle, however, the splendor of Hunyadi’s name
dimmed the glory of all. With the people, whose
chief delight was martial exploits, and in whose
eyes the Turks were the most dreadful enemy of
their country, his prestige increased from year to
year. For Hunyadi, like his powerful antagonist
the Turk, never knew what it was to rest. No other
enemy was like this one he had to cope with. The
Turkish state was so organized that it could not exist
without fresh conquests and incessant wars. The
Janissaries wanted occupation and glory, the mounted
Spahis new lands, the immense hordes which
marched at the distance of a day’s walk in advance
of the Turkish army were hungry after booty, and
the sultans themselves longed to win fresh conquests
and military glory against the infidels, as the
followers of the cross were styled by them.</p>

<p>An enemy like this was a most dangerous neighbor.
It is true that Hungary was divided from the Turkish
empire by her vassal states, Bulgaria, Wallachia,
Servia, and Bosnia, but the Turkish sultans already
looked upon these territories as their own, and were
constantly organizing inroads into Hungary from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
them. Hunyadi had passed his early life near the
border; and, accustomed to the perpetual fighting
going on there, he was also familiarized with the
magnitude of the danger. With an iron will he
determined to devote his whole strength to the
struggle against the Turks. By his gallantry he
gradually acquired the fortune necessary for this
purpose, for the kings were lavish in granting to
him again and again large estates as a compensation
for his bravery. Nor was he wanting in opportunities
against the Turks, for, having been successively
created Count of Temes, ban of Szörény, and vayvode
of Transylvania, it became his duty to defend
the border with the money and army placed in his
hands. If the Turks appeared at any point on a
marauding expedition, or to provoke hostilities,
Hunyadi was quick to meet them at once, and did
not rest until he had achieved victory.</p>

<p>In one such expedition, Ishak, the pasha of Semendria,
fared badly. This overbearing Turk, issued
from the fortress of Semendria, and, having overrun
the country, left behind him nothing but desolation
and the tears of widows and orphans. Hunyadi,
with a small troop, started in his pursuit, and, coming
up with him, he took away from him the prisoners
and the booty he had captured, and drove him and
his army back to the very walls of Semendria. The
sultan, upon hearing the news of this defeat, at once
despatched Mezid Bey with an army of 80,000 men
against Hunyadi. Orders were issued to destroy every
thing—property and human life alike; neither the
young nor the old nor the women were to be spared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
Hunyadi was well informed as to the enemy’s movements.
He knew that in this campaign the special
aim would be to kill or capture him, for his person
stood almost alone in the way of the Sultan’s
conquests and glory. The Turkish commander
offered, on the eve of the battle, an enormous reward
to the soldier who would succeed in capturing
Hunyadi. This critical occasion showed not only
the importance attributed to Hunyadi’s person by
the Turks, but also the great love with which he was
surrounded and the degree to which he was idolized
by his soldiers and comrades. One of the latter,
Simon Kemény, who knew of the intentions of the
enemy, urgently begged his leader to exchange with
him horses and accoutrements. Hunyadi at first
refused, but finally yielded to Kemény’s entreaties
and handed him over his military equipments.</p>

<p>But he built his plan of battle upon this ruse: He
ordered five hundred distinguished soldiers to be
stationed near the person of the devoted officer, and
he himself withdrew with his reserve and took up a
position in a remoter spot. The following day the
two armies engaged in battle. Every Turkish warrior
sought the famous Hungarian hero; all were eager for
the glory of capturing and killing him, and anxious
to secure the prize set on his head. They all knew
his face—which strikingly resembled that of Simon
Kemény—and his accoutrements, which had been
minutely described to them by their comrades. They
at once made a rush on Kemény, the pretended
Hunyadi. This gallant hero, with his five hundred
men, stood the brunt of the onslaught with super<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>human
courage; the enemy were literally mowed
down by their swords, but, at last, they had to
give way to superior numbers, and their brave
leader laid down his life on the battle-field. The
Turkish soldiers precipitated themselves eagerly
and with shouts of triumph upon his inanimate body,
when suddenly Hunyadi broke upon them—the real
and living Hunyadi whom the enemy had already
thought dead. At this sight, the enemy, who, a few
moments ago, felt sure of their victory, were seized
with a panic, and sought safety in flight. Their
leader, Mezid Bey himself, and his son lay lifeless,
with battered skulls, on the field of battle.</p>

<p>The entire Turkish camp, with immense treasures
and its military stores, as well as numerous prisoners,
fell into the hands of the victorious Hungarians.
Many a brave Hungarian warrior, it is true, had lost
his life, and the devoted Simon Kemény had found
the death he expected, but the country was saved,
and the Hungarian losses were as nothing compared
with the losses of the Turks. The devout Hunyadi
afterwards caused a chapel to be erected from
the proceeds of the Turkish booty in memory of his
martyred comrades.</p>

<p>The news of the ignominious defeat reached Sultan
Murat at Adrianople; he was greatly incensed,
and swore dire vengeance against the Hungarians.
He summoned before him his brother-in-law, entrusted
to his command eighty thousand men, and
ordered him to invade Hungary, to lay every thing
waste with fire and steel, and to annihilate Hunyadi
and his army. The Turkish commander, letting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
loose his Tartars, entered Hungary quite suddenly
through Wallachia. The frontier is here formed by
gigantic mountains, and but narrow passes lead from
one country into the other. Through one of these
passes, the Vaskapu (Iron Gate), the Turkish army
passed into Hungary. The invaders had hardly
time to rest from their fatigues, when Hunyadi with
his army appeared before the unsuspecting enemy,
ready to give battle. Abedin was surprised and disconcerted;
he thought the Hungarians would fly
before him, and they were facing him. Hunyadi
entrenched his foot soldiery in a wagon-camp, whilst
he himself with his horse attacked the Spahis (Turkish
cavalry). After scattering the latter, he turned
against the Turkish infantry, the Janissaries, in the
rear, but the attack was only a feigned one. As if
fearful of being surrounded, he suddenly began to
retreat with his army to that portion of the valley
where the wagon-camp was stationed. The Janissaries,
leaving their protected positions, started with
wild exultation in pursuit of the Hungarians.</p>

<p>Hunyadi, having taken up his position at the fortified
place in the narrow valley, directed a side
attack against the Turkish horse and drove them
back upon the fighting Janissaries, whose storming
of the wagon fortress was attended with as little
success as that of the waves beating against the
solid rock. The Turkish army could not display its
strength, and confusion and wild disorder soon seized
the troops. Their commander, perceiving that it
was impossible to save his army, mounted his horse
and galloped away. Fifteen thousand Hungarians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
were opposed, on that occasion, to eighty thousand
Turks, inured to war, well trained, and accustomed
to victory. The Turkish Janissaries, whose impenetrable
line never broke, were annihilated; the cavalry,
the far-famed Spahis, were scattered; and the
whole Turkish army was in part massacred and in
part put to disorderly flight. The meanest portion
only saved themselves by running away; the best of
the warriors perished, for the Turkish troops were
by no means lacking in personal courage. The
principal difference between the opponents was that
the Turkish army was usually too confident of victory,
and was often led by incompetent generals,
while among the Hungarians discipline prevailed.
Hunyadi, furthermore, not only gave battle according
to plans concerted by his military genius, but
understood also, during the tumult and confusion of
the battle, how to execute with his troops rapid and
precise movements. These qualities had decided
the present battle, and were also the secret of his
future triumphs.</p>

<p>All Europe hailed with joy and admiration the
splendid victories of the Hungarian arms, for the
whole Christian world had witnessed with alarm the
extension of the power of the dreaded Osmanlis.
Not only Hunyadi himself, but all his companions in
arms, felt that, in inflicting such heavy losses upon the
Turks, they were not defending Hungary alone, but
saving all Christendom from that Turkish rule which
had exhibited a boundless appetite for continental
extension. Aware of this state of things, Hunyadi
initiated a policy exceeding in boldness the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
hitherto pursued by him. He appealed to all the
rulers of Europe—to some personally, to others
through the king and the pontiff of Rome—to lend
him their aid, and he declared that, if they responded
to his appeal, he was ready to begin an
offensive war against the Turks.</p>

<p>All Europe received with satisfaction both his
plan and request, but all he could obtain was gracious
words and fair promises; aid in any tangible
shape was flowing in but thinly. The Poles (the
Hungarian king Uladislaus being also their king)
sent a tolerably large contingent; in Germany,
France, and Bohemia, too, there were many ready
to enlist in a holy war against the unbelieving Turks,
as had been formerly done in the time of the crusaders,
and these joined Hunyadi’s camp. The
southern vassal states sent also some forces. The
principal army, however, was still composed of
Hunyadi’s Hungarians, which was joined by the
king’s own troops. They may have numbered altogether
forty thousand men. The king himself joined
in the offensive campaign (in July, 1443) and placed
himself at the head of the motley army. His leadership
proved an injury rather than an advantage, for
the discipline would have been far more perfect in
the army if Hunyadi in person, with his own men,
had taken the lead. The Hungarian general, nevertheless,
defeated the Turks in their own country in
four smaller engagements and in two larger battles.
When the Hungarian army approached the Balkans—the
heart of the Turkish empire in Europe—they
were already wading in snow. They nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
marched on, undaunted by the enormous mountains
and the impracticable and narrow passes. But the
Turks had already taken up their positions along
the difficult passes, on the mountain tops, and in the
passes themselves, in such a manner that they had
made sure of every advantage. Hunyadi quickly
perceived that the position of the sultan behind
such entrenchments and bulwarks was impregnable.
Being, therefore, foiled in his desire to aim an offensive
blow at the enemy, he endeavored to entice him
into the plain. In this he succeeded. As he was
retreating from the Balkan passes, slowly and cautiously
tracing his way back, the Turkish army
quickly started in his pursuit. The sultan reasoned
that the Hungarian army was, by this time, exhausted
with cold, the fatigues, and the extraordinary
exertions, and that it would be an easy matter
to catch them now in their own trap. But he
counted without Hunyadi. When the latter thought
the time had come for it, he turned and faced the
enemy. He selected a vantage-ground where the
Turkish army could at no time bring all their forces
into play, and must therefore offer to the Hungarians
a chance of beating them in detachments. The
struggle was protracted, for the Turks could afford,
to wait. As soon as one of their generals was defeated,
the sultan had him strangled on the spot, and
despatched in his place another general and another
army. The contest went desperately on by the
light of the moon. Every one took part in it; King
Uladislaus himself was wounded. The exasperated
Turks, after their ranks had been broken up, did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
not attempt to fly, but perished fighting. The
commander-in-chief of the sultan’s army was taken
captive.</p>

<p>The Hungarian army returned in triumph to
Buda. Close upon their heels followed the sultan’s
envoy, begging for peace. All he now asked for
was to be let alone in his own country, and he in
turn would not molest Hungary. This was an important
concession, for the faith of the sultans had
heretofore been held to forbid them to enter into a
parley with, and still less to entreat peace of, the
infidel Christians. But the sultan had just now a
special reason for peace. Half of his empire had
risen in arms against him—the Albanians in Europe
and Mohammedan rebels in Asia. As usual with
states based upon violence, the discontented rose on
all sides at the news of the first lost battle. This
was the effect of Hunyadi’s campaign.</p>

<p>The terms of peace offered by the sultan were of
the most flattering and tempting nature. He promised
a great deal of money, territory, mines, and
captives. Hunyadi was now in favor of peace; he felt
that he must gather strength. Peace was therefore
concluded, the king swearing by the Gospel and the
sultan by the Koran. The ambassadors of the sultan
had hardly left Hungary when Cardinal Julian, the
pope’s nuncio, arrived in the country and declared,
in the pontiff’s name, the oath of Uladislaus, the
Hungarian king, to be null and void, adjuring him,
at the same time, by all the saints, to hasten and
make use of this opportunity to annihilate the Turks,
and insisting that one so favorable would never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
occur again. All Europe’s eyes were upon them,
he added, and all Europe wished to take part in the
struggle. And, indeed, the Christian princes hastened
to protest against the peace, and offered money
and soldiers in abundance to continue the war.</p>

<p>Meanwhile news arrived that the Italian naval
squadron had appeared in the Turkish waters to
intercept the sultan’s crossing over from Asia to
Europe. It was urged that now had come the time
to fall upon the Turkish empire, which was without a
master. The papal nuncio summoned all his eloquence
to prove that the peace concluded with the
Turk was not valid, for the word given to an unbeliever
was not binding, and God did not listen to an
oath deposited into pagan hands. “All Europe,”
he continued, “scoffed at this peace, and the honor
and martial glory of the Hungarian nation will be
like naught if she persisted in keeping it. It will
disgrace her heroic name.”</p>

<p>There was no occasion for adding more; the Hungarians
had no wish to be thought cowards, and to
this they preferred perjury. They enthusiastically
resolved upon war. Hunyadi alone remained cold;
he had no faith in big words and promises. But he
was compelled to obey the commands of his king.
He collected about 20,000 men, and with these he
again marched into the Turkish empire. The famous
European contribution had dwindled down to a
few hundred soldiers and a few thousand florins, but
it was hoped that many of the discontented would
join them on their march. And, indeed, the vayvode
of Wallachia joined them with about 10,000 men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
but he could not help remarking to the king with
regard to the forces of Sultan Mura, that the latter
was in the habit of surrounding himself when on a
hunting expedition with a retinue more numerous
than the entire Hungarian army. It was, however,
too late to think of drawing back.</p>

<p>And now bad news came crowding in; it seemed
as if good fortune had altogether deserted the Hungarians.
The Prince of Servia refused to join them.
The Albanians failed in their attempt to cut their
way to the Hungarians, and what seemed most incredible
of all, the Italian naval squadron, whose
task it was to have been to hinder the sultan’s crossing
over to Europe, had itself carried over the Turk
for good money. The Hungarians were left alone
and forsaken in the foreign country. There was
reason enough now for retreating, and there were
some who counselled retreat. It was Hunyadi’s
turn now to interfere. He declared that he did not
fear the Turks under any circumstances, and if they
had got so far they were bound to engage them in
battle by beginning the attack themselves. As soon
as Hunyadi came to the fore, confidence was at once
restored; his person inspired the army with courage,
and they continued their march against the Turks.
The two opposing armies met near Varna, on the
10th of November, 1444. The sultan had pitched
his tent on the top of a hill, and near it he had the
document, upon which the treaty of peace was written,
hoisted on a pole. He had with him more than
100,000 men ready for the fray. But the order of
battle of the Hungarian army was again most ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>mirable,
such as could only be suggested by the
lofty genius of Hunyadi. To every man was assigned
his part and place, nor was any exception
made in this respect in favor of the king. He obtained
a post where no danger could reach him, and
Hunyadi solemnly engaged him not to leave his
place until he himself would call upon him to do
so.</p>

<p>The battle now commenced. Hunyadi with his
reserve horse-troop went wherever there was most
danger, assisting, encouraging, and commanding.
The first set-to took place between the cavalry. The
struggle did not last long; the brilliant Turkish cavalry
was put to flight in disorder. At this desperate
sight the sultan put spurs to his horse, and turning
its head was about to leave the battle-field, but the
commanders near him seized the bridle of his horse,
and menaced him with death if he did not go on
with the battle. The sultan, taking courage again,
ordered fresh troops into the fight, and the battle began
to rage with renewed fury. In the midst of the
sanguinary contest the two hostile leaders met face
to face. Karafi Bey, his eyes sparkling, fell upon
Hunyadi, and lifted his sword, but before he could
strike a blow he slid from his horse pierced to the
heart. The fall of their leader was the signal for the
wild flight of the Turkish horse.</p>

<p>The Polish banner-bearers, surrounding the king,
were envious witnesses of Hunyadi’s victory, and
urged Uladislaus, who was hardly able to restrain his
youthful ardor, to participate in the engagement, by
representing to him that victory was already assured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
that he should not leave all the glory to Hunyadi,
and that he should, at least, draw his sword and
show himself a hero worthy of the double crown.</p>

<p>The king, forgetting his promise, accompanied by
the banner of the country, made straight for the
Janissaries, who had, as yet, hardly been in the fight.
Hunyadi immediately saw the king’s movement, and
followed him as swiftly as he could. Upon this the
king penetrated more deeply still into the ranks of
the Janissaries, Hunyadi being unable now to cut
his way to his sovereign. The king’s companions
succumbed one after the other. At last a Janissary
succeeded in creeping up close to the king’s horse,
and striking at the horse’s feet with his sword, he
brought it down. Horse and rider fell, and the king
was instantly despatched. The mad fray lasted a few
minutes longer, when suddenly the pale head of the
king, in his silver helmet, stuck on a pike, became
visible. At this sight the Hungarian army and their
leaders lost their senses, and the campaign came to a
sudden end. The victorious Hungarians became
fugitives, and Hunyadi himself returned to his home
a lonely wanderer. The sultan, in surveying the
bloody battle-field, exclaimed: “I wish my enemies
only a victory like this.” The Turks were not in a
condition to pursue the defeated Hungarians.</p>

<p>The discomfited army crept back to their country,
bringing with them the news that Hungary was without
a king. The uppermost question now was who
should be elected king. The plight of Hungary at
that time was a sorry one, indeed. The king had
left no children behind him, and yet there was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
heir to the throne. When Albert of Hapsburg, the
predecessor of Uladislaus, died, in 1439, his widow
was <i>enceinte</i>, and she afterwards gave birth to a boy.
The partisans of the late queen caused this her son,
Ladislaus, to be crowned at once. The great majority,
however, and Hunyadi with them, wanted
on the throne a man who would be able to be their
leader in the struggle against the Turks. The result
was the election of Uladislaus, the Polish king, in
1440. The widowed queen with her son repaired to
the court of the Duke of Austria, and from there she
caused Hungary to be devastated by the Bohemian,
John Ziska.</p>

<p>It was quite natural that after the death of
Uladislaus the whole nation should look to the child
Ladislaus as the future king. But the Austrian duke
claimed a large sum under the title of the expenses
of education of the young prince, a sum which the
Hungarians were neither able nor willing to pay.
Whilst this matter was being discussed, Hunyadi,
being the captain-general of the country, was temporarily
entrusted with the conduct of the principal
affairs of state. Two years later he was elected
governor of the country, with powers that but little
differed from those of royalty.</p>

<p>As governor he deemed it his paramount duty to
resume hostilities against the Turks. His mind was
busy again with the plan to which he had devoted
his life and fortune—namely, to attack the Turks
and to drive them from Europe. In 1448 the sultan,
at the head of an army of 150,000 men, invaded
Albania, a country with which Hungary, owing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
their community of interests, deeply sympathized.
Hunyadi thought this an opportune moment to
carry out his plan. From abroad he received again
assurances of aid, but in the end they turned out to
be, as before, empty promises. Putting his trust in
God and himself, he started with 24,000 men. It
was his purpose to unite his forces with those of
Scanderbeg, the commander-in-chief of the Albanians.
But as soon as the news of Hunyadi’s advance
reached the sultan, he left the Albanians and
marched against his old and most implacable enemy.
He offered him peace, but Hunyadi replied by drawing
up his army in battle array. The battle was
fought with great desperation, the fight continuing
for days, and although the Turkish army outnumbered
five times the Hungarians, the strategy of
Hunyadi rendered the issue doubtful for some time.
At the last moment, however, it was decided in favor
of the Turks. Treason had turned the scale; the
Wallachian vayvode, losing confidence in the wearied
troops of Hunyadi, deserted with 8,000 men and
joined the sultan. When the Hungarians saw this,
they refused to listen any further to their commanders,
and, scattering, they fled. Hunyadi himself
escaped with great difficulty only. Whilst wandering
towards his country on foot, unarmed, and
through impassable roads, he fell into the hands of
two Turkish marauders. They little knew what a
distinguished person they had captured, but there
was no mistake about the golden cross on his breast.
Luckily for Hunyadi they both coveted the cross
and began quarrelling over it, and finally fell to fisti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>cuffs.
During their fight Hunyadi suddenly drew
the sword of one of them, slaying him with it; the
other, on seeing this, took to his heels. He had
hardly escaped one danger, when another was in
store for him. On his way he had hired a guide,
who, instead of taking him to his own country,
brought him to Brankovitch, the Servian prince, the
man who, since the campaign of 1443, had been constantly
crossing his plans. The treacherous Servian,
who was licking now the hands of the Hungarians,
now of the Turks, entered into negotiations with the
Turkish sultan concerning Hunyadi’s head. The
latter, however, esteemed, even in his enemy, the
pure-minded hero, and refused to entertain so base
an offer.</p>

<p>Hunyadi returned to Hungary, and hastened to
forget the injury done to him by the Servian
prince; but the Turks he did not forget. In his
most desperate straits he steadily kept before his
eyes—the main object of his life—the ruin of the
Turks. In 1453, the child-king, Ladislaus V., began
his reign; but, although Hunyadi then relinquished
his position as governor of Hungary, he still remained
the captain-general of the country, the commander-in-chief
of the army, and as such he missed
no opportunity to injure his arch-enemy.</p>

<p>This same year, 1453, witnessed a most remarkable
event in the history of Europe. Mohammed
II., the new sultan, took Constantinople, the capital
of the Greek empire and the gate of Europe, and
made it the capital of his empire. “There is one
God in heaven, and one Lord on earth, and I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
that Lord!” exclaimed the sultan on entering Constantinople.
All Europe trembled; Hunyadi alone
remained calm and prepared for war. After a few
minor engagements, Turks and Hungarians stood
face to face again near Belgrade in 1456. This fortress
was the gate of Hungary, and the great sultan
wanted to get possession of it. For this purpose he
determined to make a supreme effort, feeling that
the seizure of this fortified place would decide the
fate of generations to come. He led over 150,000
men under the walls of that famous fortress, and
hastened to station his ships on the Danube, on
which Belgrade lies, in order to cut off the communication
between the Hungarian army and the garrison,
and thus to isolate the latter. The Hungarian
army itself did not number, even now, over 15,000
men, hardly more than those whom Hunyadi had
been able to collect by his own exertions. Only this
time, however, the great captain did not stand alone,
but received great help from another quarter. A
monk of magic eloquence, John Capistrano, who was
sent by the pope to the country to preach a crusade,
had, by the irresistible power of his appeals, collected
60,000 crusaders to assist Hunyadi. These men were
armed with scythes and pole-axes only, and were led
by the sound of bells instead of words of military
command; but their fanaticism was quite equal to
that of the Mohammedan Turk.</p>

<p>With an army composed of such warriors Hunyadi
engaged in the great contest. His first effort was
directed to the river, in order to relieve the garrison
of the fortress. After an engagement of five hours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
the great naval squadron of the Turks was scattered
by the small galleys which had been the objects of
the enemy’s ridicule, but which were led to the attack
by fanatic crusaders under the captaincy of
Hunyadi. This restored the communication of the
Hungarian army with the Hungarian garrison. Still
Mohammed looked with scorn at the rabble collected
on the opposite bank, the leaders of whom were
largely monks, and he swore an oath that in two
months’ time, he would plant the proud crescent on
the walls of Buda, the capital of Hungary. For
eight days and eight nights the Turkish guns roared
against Belgrade, and on the ninth day Mohammed
ordered a general assault. The assault was renewed
three times, and three times were the Turks repulsed.
At the last moment, when the strength of the besieged
seemed ready to give way, the Hungarian
commander ordered the fascines soaked with oil and
pitch, which were piled up in the ditches, to be set
on fire and to be hurled at the storming men. Confusion
seized the assailants, and each sought safety
for himself, for he who did not escape met with a
miserable death in the flames. Meanwhile the defence
was rapidly changing into an attack along the
whole line; the crusaders, mad with the excitement
of the struggle, rushed forward, while Hunyadi
directed an orderly attack against the Turkish camp.
The engagement now became general, and the sultan
himself received a wound. Dismayed, he took to
flight, his troops following. Nothing could keep
them longer together; the immense army was scattered
to the winds, leaving behind them, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
walls of the famous fortress, 40,000 killed and 300
cannon.</p>

<p>At that most glorious moment of Hunyadi’s life,
when the Turks were put to flight by the bare mention
of his name, this Christian hero, suddenly and
without any premonition, breathed his last. He did
not live to hear the panegyrics and felicitations of
all Europe, the grateful recognition of his services
by his own nation. His mighty frame sank under
the weight of the fatigue of war, and, after a brief
agony, he expired. His inveterate enemy, the great
sultan himself, expressed grief at the news of his
death, pronouncing him to be the ablest general in
Europe.</p>

<p>Many there were, however, who rejoiced at his
death. For, like all great men, he too had enemies
against whom he was engaged in a life-and-death
struggle as much as against the Turks. He had his
envious rivals from the moment he had struggled
into fame and had acquired a fortune. These men
cared little to remember that he was indebted for
both to his talents and courage. Some of the great
lords, who were able to trace back their pedigrees to
past centuries, looked upon him, the son of a simple
noble, as an upstart. When he afterwards became
captain-general and governor, they refused to obey
him, but he made them obey by force of his arms.
They were only silenced, however; in their innermost
hearts they both hated and feared him. Among
these were Garay, Brankovics, and Czilley, all of them
connections of the royal house. The latter, Ulric
Czilley, a wily and base man, who, though a for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>eigner,
had pushed himself into the first place near
the minor King Ladislaus V., was unremitting in his
intrigues against him. He and his companions made
the shallow-minded young king believe that Hunyadi
and his two sons, who were growing into manhood,
were ambitious of the crown, and, under this pretext,
but without the king’s knowledge, they laid traps for
him. The fearless hero faced all such base machinations
with the loftiness of a truly martial spirit.
The secret attacks he met with caution and straightforwardness,
and the slanderous insinuation that he
coveted the throne he refuted by the simplicity of
his life. Rich enough to have at any moment ten
thousand men at his back, he was always as modest
and unselfish as a monk. His detractors reflected
on his great wealth, forgetting that his entire income
was spent in armaments against the Turks.</p>

<p>He lived and died like a true knight, and in Hungarian
history he will live forever as their grandest
hero. If he did not achieve his most ardent wish,
the expulsion of the Turks from Europe, his will
always remain the merit of having made the arms of
Hungary respected and feared by the Turks, and they
no longer dared to look upon his country as an easy
conquest. Over sixty years elapsed before a Turkish
sultan again ventured to threaten Belgrade.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br /><br />

<small>KING MATTHIAS.<br /><br />

1458-1490.</small></h2>

<p>Matthias, the son of Hunyadi, was indebted for
his elevation to the throne to the prestige of his
father, who was the idol of the nation, but it was
through his own genius alone that he strengthened
the throne and became famous, mighty, and, perhaps,
the greatest king of whom his country could
boast. He excelled alike as a soldier and leader of
armies, as a statesman and diplomatist, and as a man
delighting in science and art. In those warlike days
it would not have been possible for him to become
conspicuous among his contemporaries and to become
a powerful king, unless he had, in the first
place, shown ability as a soldier. Matthias inherited
the courage and soldierly qualities of his great father,
and, following in his footsteps, became the foremost
general of his age, combining rare personal gallantry
with a remarkable capacity for military organization.
The splendid example of his father had been before
his eyes since his most tender years; it was his father
who initiated him into the skilful handling of arms
and into the secrets of strategy, and both his father
and his famous mother, Elizabeth Szilágyi, vied with
each other in inuring his body and mind to the strug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>gles
and dangers of which, since his earliest childhood,
so large a share had been his lot.</p>

<p>Trained amid warlike games, he very soon had to
face serious struggles, for the men who had looked
upon John Hunyadi with envy and jealousy extended
their ill feeling to his two handsome boys,
Matthias and his elder brother, Ladislaus. No
secret was made before the youths of the dangers
that surrounded them; they were taught rather
to brave than to avoid them. Ladislaus, less fortunate
than his brother, soon fell a victim to the
machinations directed against both. Ladislaus was
threatened with assassination in his own castle at the
hands of Czilley, who was a foreigner and the guardian
and friend of the boy-king. His men, attracted
by the noise of the scuffle which ensued, rushed in
and killed the would-be murderer. The king vowed
that he would not molest Ladislaus for this act of
self-defence, but he had him afterwards seized,
thrown into prison, and executed without warrant
of law or judicial sentence. This was the work
of the enemies of the house of Hunyadi, but very
soon they had to pay the penalty of their iniquity.
The mass of the nation was roused, and upon the
sudden death of Ladislaus V. in his other kingdom,
amongst the Czechs, Matthias, the surviving son of
Hunyadi, was proclaimed king of Hungary.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="i240" id="i240">
<img src="images/i_240.png" width="500" height="321" alt="PRESBURG." />
<span class="caption">PRESBURG.</span></a></div>

<p>Although but fifteen years old when he ascended
the throne, he both knew and was accustomed to
the dangers that lurked around him, and it was not
long before he proved that he could cope with them.
Indeed his natural disposition and early training
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a><br /><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>rather led him to seek danger. From his earliest
childhood he worshipped heroes, and nothing delighted
him more than the ballads, legends, and
heroic songs glorifying the gallant deeds and wonderful
performances of such leaders of men, as Attila,
Alexander the Great, Roland, the French Knight, or
his own father. He could listen to these stories all
day long, forgetting both hunger and thirst. As he
grew to manhood and became king, he had opportunity
himself to perform the great deeds he had
admired in others. His personal courage knew no
limits, and his reckless daring frequently confounded
his own men, who, not without cause, feared for his
life.</p>

<p>There was one remarkable trait which particularly
characterized his valorous deeds as well as his other
acts, and that was his love of justice. To this might
be traced, in most cases, his boldest actions. Nothing
afforded him greater pleasure than to unmask the
hypocrite, and to shame the bully and braggart. On
occasions like these he would often risk his life to
make the truth triumph. Many an instance of this
kind is related of him. On one occasion, a German
knight, by the name of Holubar, came to Buda, the
capital of Hungary. He paraded everywhere his
gigantic frame and extraordinary strength, and was
indeed thought to be invincible in the tournaments
where mounted knights rushed at each other, lance
in hand, for he invariably precipitated his adversary
to the ground. King Matthias, anxious to measure
arms with the big-bodied German, challenged him.
The latter declined the challenge, fearing lest he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
might do some harm to the king, and be in consequence
exposed to ill treatment. But the king insisted,
and Holubar finally consented. He was determined,
however, to slide from his saddle at the
slightest thrust from the king. Somehow the king
heard of his determination, and immediately caused
him to be summoned to his presence. He there
vowed, by all the saints, that if he perceived Holubar
doing this, he would have him executed, and at
the same time made him swear that he would fight
with him as if he were the knight’s mortal enemy.
The contest took place in the presence of many
thousands, and many doubted the king’s success,
comparing the German giant with the middle-sized
Matthias. The two combatants rushed at each other
with tremendous thrusts; the steeled muscles of the
king proved superior to the heavy bulk of his adversary,
who reeled from his horse, struck by a heavy
blow on the forehead, and lay with his arm broken
and fainting on the ground. The king, too, staggered
by his adversary’s thrust, had to slide off the
saddle holding on by his horse’s bridle. The king,
having humiliated the bragging foreigner, sent him
away with presents of horses, splendid dresses, and a
large purse of money. This happened shortly after
his elevation to the throne, showing that he then
already was a practical master in the use of arms.
Matthias was of middle size, but the trunk of his
body tall in comparison with his legs, which were
rather short, and it was owing to this freak of nature
that when on horseback he always overtopped his
fellow-riders. He was broad-shouldered, deep-chest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>ed,
and his limbs were as hardened as steel. On this
solid frame rested a massive yet finely cut head, and
his eyes were as sharp as those of the falcon. He
was able to concentrate his strength and will on one
point, never losing his self-confidence, never wavering,
and full of endurance. He never vacillated, and
sure of the present and of the coming moment, was
always ready for action. He possessed an even nature,
and was equally unruffled and steady in single
combat and on the battle-field, in his private and his
public life. He at all times produced the impression
of a man full of power and determination, and of a
mind of large culture and many-sidedness.</p>

<p>We shall now speak of him as the soldier, for he
will appear before us during most of his career in
wars and battles. He waged war, on several occasions,
against his neighbors on the north, the Poles
and Czechs, defeating them often, and finally becoming
the king of the Czechs. On the south he fought
numerous smaller battles, but almost without cessation,
against the sultan. His most inveterate enemy,
however, was Frederic, the envious and avaricious
emperor of Germany, his western neighbor, who incessantly
harassed him. Matthias was engaged in four
great wars against him, and finally captured, in 1485,
Frederic’s capital, Vienna, compelling the German
emperor to go begging from convent to convent,
seated on a wagon drawn by oxen.</p>

<p>Hungary was, at that period, beset by many
troubles and enemies, but her name was honored and
respected everywhere. The sword was in everybody’s
hand, and it almost seemed as if men were born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
with it. It was the prevailing characteristic of
European society, in that age, that all men went
about armed, and were ready to draw their swords
on the least provocation, and in Hungary especially,
where fighting against the neighbors was constantly
going on, this fashion was more prevalent than elsewhere.
King Matthias was well aware that the
rash, passionate, hot-headed, free, and soldier-nation
he ruled over would but reluctantly submit to restraint.
He was, nevertheless, determined to introduce
discipline amongst his soldiers. It was an exceedingly
difficult task, considering that the armies
of Europe in general were, in those days, undisciplined,
loosely organized, composed of motley elements,
and not subjected to uniform military training.
But Matthias was not at a loss for a remedy,
being a man to inquire, to observe, to learn from
others, and to put to use what he had learned. He
remembered the example of his father, who had
drilled his own soldiers, the lessons derived from the
study of ancient Roman generalship and from conversations
with the most renowned contemporary
captains, and finally he did not spurn to profit by
the example of his enemies, the Turks. The Turkish
Janissaries, the most famous foot-soldiery in the
world, were well-disciplined troops, forming a permanent
and standing nucleus for the Turkish forces.</p>

<p>A similar standing body of soldiers was now organized
by King Matthias. He employed his genius
in their training, kept them together, supported them
by his own means, and established discipline amongst
them by the force of his character. This was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
famous <i>black troop</i>, one of the corner-stones of his
power, and, next to the French, the earliest standing
army in Europe. These soldiers he attached to his
person by the strongest ties. He lavishly bestowed
upon them both pay and booty, and made them sharers
of his triumphs. But it was, above all, the rare
charm of his personal qualities which won for him their
affections. They were not only faithfully devoted to
him during his life, but fondly cherished his memory
after his death. He himself trained and instructed
them, sparing neither time nor trouble to accomplish
his purpose. He set them a bright example in all soldierly
duties. He shared with his soldiers all the hardships
of war; suffered with them cold, hunger, and
thirst, and the fatigues of forced marches. He did
not shrink from the most exposed position on the
battle-field whenever his presence was needed. At
sieges, he was often seen walking to and fro amidst
a hail of bullets and arrows, a recklessness to which
numerous lesser and larger wounds on his body
abundantly bore witness. He paid particular attention
to the ferreting out of the weak points of fortresses.
He employed clever spies for that purpose,
paying them liberally, but never placed implicit
trust in them, for he himself was a cleverer spy than
any of them. It particularly gratified him to hoodwink
an enemy by discovering his plans, even at the
risk of his life, and thus frustrating them.</p>

<p>In 1475 he laid siege to Shabatz, situated on the
southern border of the country. He was exceedingly
anxious to take the place, but knowing nothing
about its defences, he undertook in person the spy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>ing
out of the plan of the fortifications. At night
he got into a boat in company with a trusty attendant
and an oarsman, who was to row him around the
walls. They were hardly half way, when the Turks
discovered them, and hailed them with a volley of
shots, which, in spite of the darkness, struck his attendant.
The king, defying death, continued his investigations,
undaunted by the heavy fire, until he
had finished the inspection of the fortress. The
bold venture, moreover, was not thrown away, for
shortly after the place was captured. Some of his
expeditions were more amusing, but not less dangerous.</p>

<p>At the siege of Vienna, in 1485, he frequently
walked all around the walls, unattended, or, at most,
followed by a page. On one occasion, he stole
into the city in disguise. Dressed in the shabby
dress of a country boor, with a basket containing
butter and eggs on his back, he traversed the city
in every direction, selling his wares, and at the same
time spying out the condition of the fortifications.
He lounged about in the market-place, listening to
what the people talked about, and what they were
planning. He made his escape in safety, and, making
good use of what he had seen and heard, the city
shortly afterward fell into his hands.</p>

<p>Upon another occasion, his forces being stationed
opposite the Turkish camp, he assumed the disguise
of a Turk, and mixing with the country people who
entered the camp to sell their provisions, he succeeded
in passing in with them. Once there, he
had the hardihood to seek out the sultan’s tent, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
settling down near it, he went on selling provisions
and spying all day long. Upon his return to the
Hungarian camp, he sent, on the following day, a
letter to the sultan, conceived in these terms:
“Thou guardest thy camp badly, emperor, and thou
art thyself badly guarded. For yesterday I sat,
even from morn until night, near thy tent, selling
provisions. And lest thou doubtest my words, I
will tell thee now what was served on thy table.”
The sultan, upon reading this letter, became
frightened, and, together with his army, noiselessly
left the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The king was particularly rigorous in the ordering
of the sentry service. He used to rise at night and
inspect the sentinels, to see if they were awake,
and in their places. He was especially active during
sieges, being constantly on his feet. He was never
satisfied with reports alone, but was bound to look
after every thing in person. Everybody marvelled at
his incessant watchfulness. He awoke at the slightest
sound, at the merest whisper. At the same
time, he was famed for his sound slumbers amidst
the din of battle. Upon such occasions, the shouts
of the men, the roaring of the cannon, and the reports
of the musketry seemed to lull him to sleep.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="i248" id="i248">
<img src="images/i_248.png" width="500" height="334" alt="FORTRESS OF BUDA." />
<span class="caption">FORTRESS OF BUDA.</span></a></div>

<p>He was self-willed when it came to action. He
would, it is true, call a council of war, and listen to
the opinions of his captains, but in the end he nearly
always acted on his own views. He was admirable
in distinguishing idle reports from the truth,
being as indefatigable and clear-headed in his investigations
as he was quick and fertile in the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a><br /><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>certing
of plans. During the intervals of rest, he
liked to mingle with his soldiers. He would joke
and be full of mischief with them, and, especially in
his younger days, would often eat and drink with
them. He always had a kind word for the men in
the ranks, just as, in civil life, he was anxious to
impress people that he held the great lord, the poor
noble, and the peasant in equal esteem, as long as
they proved themselves worthy of it. This was
truly a rare princely virtue in his age. Always
gracious and affable, he loved to discover merit, and
to reward it. He sought out the wounded, often
even on the battle-field, inquired into their circumstances,
comforted them in their troubles, and reassured
and nursed those who were low in spirits.</p>

<p>He made it a point that his soldiers should be
regularly and punctually paid, and rather than get
into arrears with their pay, he would borrow or levy
heavy taxes. On one occasion, however, during the
Czech wars, he was completely out of funds. He
had been just pondering how to raise money for his
soldiers, when he was called upon by his captains to
join them in a game of dice. The playing was kept
up all night, and the king hardly threw any other
numbers than those indicated by him beforehand.
It was easy for him, with fortune thus in his favor,
to win 10,000 florins, a sum which he at once distributed
amongst his soldiers in the morning.</p>

<p>Full of sympathy for his soldiers, and princely in
his rewards, he yet rigidly exacted discipline, especially
in times of peril; and well might he do so,
as he himself was amongst the first to submit to it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
A comrade to his soldiers during the hours of rest,
he became a most severe commander in war, and
during the military exercises and drills. Disregard
of discipline and disobedience were punished with
death. At the tournaments, he often challenged (as
was customary in Europe during the middle ages)
his captains to combat, rigorously enjoining upon
them not to spare his person, but the very person
whom he thus distinguished was mercilessly
punished if he offended against military discipline.
At a tournament, he met in single combat, in sight
of the whole country, Szvéla, one of his captains;
yet, but a short time afterwards, he sent both him
and his companions to the gallows for breaches of
discipline and mutinous conduct. He was, however,
never cruel to his soldiers, and readily forgave offences
if he was convinced that they sprang, not from
ill-will, but from awkwardness and lack of experience.</p>

<p>During the campaign against Frederic, the emperor
of Germany, he sent against him one of
his generals by the name of Simon Nagy. Nagy,
otherwise a brave captain, was defeated, and returned
home filled with shame at his disgrace. The
king received him with a cheerful countenance,
well knowing that the gallant captain had done all
he could, and sent him back again at the head of an
army to resume the campaign. The brave soldier,
animated by his king’s confidence and magnanimity,
achieved such a triumphant victory that from that
time Frederic never again ventured to send an
army against Matthias. He was happy in the selec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>tion
of his generals, and did not object to raising a
man of merit, although of low degree, to the most
exalted position. Kinizsy, his most distinguished
captain, a man of mean fortunes, owed his elevation
to the king. This man had been, in his youth, a
plain miller-boy, endowed by nature with gigantic
strength. As a miller, he was capable of lifting with
one hand the heaviest mill-stone, and, on becoming
a leader of armies, he rushed upon his enemy with
a ponderous sword in each hand. Such was his
enormous strength that, at a great feast held on the
battle-field to celebrate his most renowned victory,
near Kenyérmezo, he, the triumphant Kinizsy himself,
stood up before the merrymaking crowd, and,
holding the dead body of a full-grown Turk in his
right hand, another in his left, and a third between
his teeth, tripped the national dance. Captains like
these contributed to the military prestige of the
king, but he owed still more to his own royal qualities.</p>

<p>The impression made by these qualities upon his
soldiers remained unchanged, for he continually
demonstrated his soldierly virtues, his affability, his
liberality, and generosity by deeds. Anecdotes in
which the king always played a pleasant part went
all the time from mouth to mouth. An old
chronicler says of him: “Never was a prince more
beloved and respected by his people and his soldiers
than he, but, at the same time, everybody feared
him as they would a savage lion.” At the sound of
the drums and the blowing of the horns, every one
stood instantly ready for the engagement, and will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>ing
to meet death for his king. During the military
drills, every eye was fixed on his person, and
every ear listened to the sound of his voice only; he
alone was the magnet that attracted and riveted the
general attention of his soldiers. In this respect,
Hungary stood alone amongst the nations of Europe,
and it was with men like these only that he was enabled
to achieve his wonderfully rapid and well-planned
strategic movements. At a time when
the armies of Europe were generally noted for their
unwieldiness, this mobility constituted one of the
chief advantages of the king’s army, and to it he
owed his most conspicuous military achievements.</p>

<p>The king, in his turn, placed the fullest confidence
in his soldiers. In the camp and on the battle-field,
as we have seen, he went about unattended, or, at
the most, accompanied by one or two of his men.
He bestowed no care upon the guarding of his person,
although at that period immense sums were
lavished by the rulers to insure their personal safety
by surrounding themselves with a body-guard composed
of picked men. He did not feel the necessity
of imitating his royal neighbors in this particular;
the love and respect of his soldiers proved a more
powerful protection than any troop of body-guards
he could have organized.</p>

<p>In summing up all we have said about Matthias as
a soldier, we obtain an interesting, attractive, and by
no means commonplace picture of him. Severe to
others, he was no less severe to himself; active, energetic,
enterprising, and crafty, he was most happy
when actively engaged. Versed in military matters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
he at times exhibited a knowledge of military science
which reminds us of a modern tactician.</p>

<p>The general historian, as well as the chronicler of
his own country, will always assign to him a conspicuous
place, not only as a ruler and statesman
distinguished in his own age, but also as an illustrious
example for the world of royal power, dignity,
and magnanimity. He entertained a high opinion
of the functions of a ruler. Being ambitious and
proud, he liked to give to the world the spectacle of
a throne occupied by a king dignified, powerful, and
splendid, who, nevertheless, paid tribute to all that
was noble and virtuous in humanity. His mind was
always busy with great affairs and bold schemes, and
he was unwearying in seeking the means of accomplishing
them. He never shrank from any task, nor
was any task too trifling for him to engage in if there
was a pressing occasion for it. He was as indefatigable
in his study attending to diplomatic affairs
as on the battle-field, unflagging in his activity, and
thoroughly informed about every thing.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of work to be done, for
Matthias took a large part in the political mazes of
Europe. He kept up connections with all Europe,
with a view to maintaining and increasing his power—a
system which was at that time pursued by no
other European ruler. The intercourse with the
foreign countries was now of a friendly now of a
hostile nature, but it never ceased. As soon as the
campaign was at an end on the battle-field, the diplomatic
contest was resumed and continued in the
study. As the king grew older and more powerful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
his troubles with the neighbors increased, for, owing
to the enhanced weight of his word, more and more
people sought him out and entered into relations with
him. Foreign ambassadors were continually either
arriving or departing from his court, while his own
emissaries were either leaving on, or returning from,
missions of lesser or greater importance concerning
affairs of state or family. Upon such occasions, especially
in the case of missions of greater importance,
he felt the whole dignity of the royal position and
spared neither pains nor money to surround it with
stateliness. The ordinary embassies usually numbered
from fifty to sixty members; the more brilliant
embassies were frequently attended by as many as
a hundred servants.</p>

<p>In 1487 Matthias sent a splendid embassy to the
court of Charles VIII., king of France, a description
of which will give an idea of the pomp displayed by
the Hungarian king. He caused three hundred horses
of uniform color to be selected, on each of which sat
a youth clad in purple velvet. These youths all
wore long gold chains on their sides, and upon entering
a city each placed a braidwork mounted with
pearls on his head. The contemporary chronicles
speak with ecstasy of the beauty of the men, of the
splendor of their dress, and of the rich harnesses of
their horses, embossed with precious stones. The
presents sent to the French king on that occasion,
consisting of costly horses, horses’ trappings, splendid
robes, vessels and ornaments of gold and silver,
amounted to a sum of no less than half a million
of florins of the currency of our days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>The embassy sent by Matthias in 1476 to the king
of Naples—whose daughter, Beatrice, became subsequently
his wife—exceeded the last named in
numbers, if not in splendor. It was composed of
church and lay magnates, scholars, prelates, soldiers
of high rank, nobles, knights, relatives of the king,
his intimates and councillors. These again were attended
by their secretaries, chamberlains, pages,
grooms and forerunners. It was a wonderfully
variegated sight, rich in coloring, this mounted
army of men dressed in costly robes of various and
glaring colors. The great lords were dressed from
head to foot in gala costumes, brilliant with gold
and silver and jewels, the nobles and knights in costumes
of colored velvet, the pages and courtiers in
colored satin—all of them mounted on high-mettled
steeds. In their train followed the numerous jesters
or fools, whom it was customary at that time for
every great lord to have by his side, to make sport,
or to tell the truth; musicians, especially, according
to the fashion of the day, trumpeters, drummers,
and harpists; and, finally, players and buffoons, all
of them attired and bedizened in motley, parti-colored
and tawdry costumes.</p>

<p>The horses’ keep alone cost this embassy a million
of florins, present currency. But not satisfied with
carrying on their backs half of the current wealth of
the country they came to represent, the members of
the embassy had brought with them, besides, vessels
of gold and silver, and jewelry of all kind, to be distributed
as presents, or to be paraded about. Ostentation
was the fashion of the day; objects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
luxury were still a sort of novelty, and those possessing
them were anxious to have the pleasure of their
display. There was another feature about the pageant
of this mission which made it almost unique;
and with which Matthias created the greatest sensation.
This was a band of Turkish prisoners of high
rank, clad in costly caftans with golden turbans on
their heads, who preceded the brilliant Hungarian
procession upon their entering the Italian cities.
These prisoners had just been captured by the king
near Shabatz, and they were to serve as an evidence
of Hungarian prowess. At that time half Europe
stood in awe of the powerful Turks, particularly the
Italians, who, although excelling in art and science,
were wretched and pusillanimous soldiers. Both
Matthias and his father, John Hunyadi, were known
to the Italians as the most powerful and successful
foes of the dreaded Turks, and the prestige of the
names of these two warriors won greater respect for
the embassy than all the wealth and luxury displayed
by it.</p>

<p>Brilliant as were the embassies sent by Matthias
to foreign courts, he was no less gratified by the arrival
of missions to his own, which were looked upon
as a sort of holiday event. The king himself was
inclined to be liberal if he wished to do honor to
any one. There were, besides, gathered about his
person a motley crowd of Hungarian, German, and
Czech magnates, prelates and nobles, attentive to
every command of his. Then there were the court
attendants amounting to many hundreds, and all
these persons required but a nod from the king to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
devote themselves to the preparation of a brilliant
reception. They were quick to don their sumptuous
and costly dresses, they brandished their weapons
inlaid with precious stones, they pranced on their
steeds caparisoned in colored silk and velvet, and,
attended by an army of courtiers and servants, clad
in garments representing all the colors of the rainbow,
the procession went out amid the blast of horns,
to meet the ambassador and to escort him to the
court. In 1487, John Valentini, the envoy from the
court of Ferrara, in Italy, and in 1488, Melchior
Russ, the Swiss envoy, were honored by receptions
of this kind. In December, 1479, John Anagarini,
the papal cardinal ambassador, was received with
the greatest imaginable pomp, by the king in person,
who, attended by his church and lay dignitaries,
came out to meet him at three o’clock in the morning.
Thousands of wax torches shed a light as
broad as day over the dark and wintry scene. Three
days after the arrival of the cardinal the solemn
audience took place. The king appeared in his
royal robes, surrounded by the highest dignitaries of
the court, and by the church and lay magnates, all
sumptuously dressed. The king well understood the
art of astonishing and dazzling his visitors by the
dignity of his presence and by the display of lavish
pomp.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="i258" id="i258">
<img src="images/i_258.png" width="500" height="321" alt="RUINS OF VISEGRÁD." />
<span class="caption">RUINS OF VISEGRÁD.</span></a></div>

<p>Upon one occasion he was staying at Visegrád, his
splendid palace a short distance from Buda, when
the sultan’s ambassador arrived. It gratified the
pride of Matthias to dazzle the eyes of the Turkish
envoy, who was accustomed to the brilliant surround<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a><br /><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>ings
of the sultan, with the splendor of his own
court. Visegrád, which was called by the contemporaries
“an earthly paradise,” fully suited his purpose.
The envoy and his train were brought from
their city quarters to the royal castle, in order to be
admitted to the solemn audience with the king. As
the gates of the castle were thrown open a gorgeous
spectacle met their eyes. The king stood on an eminence
of one of his hanging gardens. Around him,
above and below him, were grouped the great of
the land and his courtiers, clad in silk, velvet, gold,
and silver robes, with shining arms. At this unexpected
sight the envoy was struck with awe. In
confusion he drew nearer, but as his eyes met the
proud look of the king he became so embarrassed
that he lost the command of his voice, and was only
able to stammer out, after a pause: “The padishah
greets you, the padishah greets you.” The king,
perceiving his painful hesitation, had him led back
to his quarters. After the lapse of a few days he
was conducted again into the king’s presence, who,
after having bestowed upon the envoy rich presents,
sent him back to his master with the proud message
to “send another time an ambassador who, at least,
can speak.”</p>

<p>Of such a nature were the audiences granted to
foreign envoys. The audiences granted to his own
subjects lacked, of course, the pomp and pageant of
the former, but the king was particularly careful and
painstaking in the treatment of the matters thus
brought before him. This was more especially the
case during the beginning of his reign. His first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
wife, the daughter of the Czech king, whom he had
married in 1458, died a few years afterwards, leaving
him a widower, and the ceremonial of the court, in
the absence of a queen, admitted of an unrestrained
intercourse with his people. But he married again
in 1476 the daughter of the king of Naples, Princess
Beatrice. With her presence Italian etiquette and
formality began to prevail in the royal court, and
free access to the king’s person became more and
more difficult. In his youth the business of his
doorkeepers was but scant, for the doors stood wide
open for the petitioners, who were kindly received
by the young king. Nor was the number of these
small, for the king’s fame as a friend to justice had
spread all over the country. A whole army of petitioners,
from the great lord to the simple peasant,
frequently besieged the doors of the audience hall,
for Matthias was known to treat them all with uniform
affability. He attentively listened to and
duly weighed the petitions and complaints of all.
This was a matter of great importance at a time
when a privileged class, the nobles, were the masters
of the property of the numerous peasantry, and frequently
held control even of their lives. The laws
at that period were both loose and defective, and
the judges could, with impunity, either misinterpret
or distort their meaning to the injury of the suitor.
Besides, in that age nearly every noble had a train
amounting to a small army, and the temptation
proved frequently irresistible to be his own judge
and to treat the weaker party as he pleased. Such
was then the condition of things all over Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>The most efficacious remedy for these evils was a
king just and strong, who was not loth to inquire
into abuses and was ready to lend the weight of
his kingly command and of armed force against the
recalcitrant. Matthias was a ruler equal to such a
task. Many excellent laws were introduced during
his reign, and he had both the sense of justice and
the power to enforce them. The very knowledge of
the existence of such a final appeal greatly improved
the administration of justice, for every one was aware
that the king was a man of his word, and that his
threats were not empty utterances, but were sure to
be followed by swift and severe punishment. He
was as quick in disposing of the matters submitted
to him as he was careful in their consideration. If
he ever delayed affairs they were mostly connected
with important questions of state, diplomacy, and
finances, requiring caution in their management.
On such occasions he was master in the art of keeping
silent, and might have excited the envy of the
craftiest Italian diplomatist by his wariness. His mind
was not easily open to extraneous influences; he
liked to get at the bottom of all complaints and accusations
by personal investigation. He brought
into the management of civil affairs the habits exhibited
by him on the battle-field; he was always
inspecting and investigating. It was a matter of
frequent occurrence with the king to go among the
people in disguise in order to study their characters
and dispositions, to learn their complaints and
troubles, and, if possible, to give at once a helping-hand.
During these expeditions he strayed unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
into the villages, exposing himself frequently to the
overbearing treatment of a village judge, a landed
noble, or a constable, and even to occasional blows,
but if he afterwards got hold of the guilty parties he
showed them on his part no mercy. In his disguise
he was indifferent to the scoffs and gibes levelled at
him; he rather enjoyed the incongruous and comical
plights he often found himself in, but at the same
time he was apt to give and to take a joke. Of
course the king always laughed last, when the disgraced
culprits, after being punished, ruefully slunk
away. He was, as a general thing, very fond of
good-natured intrigues, and liked to season even
graver matters with a bit of pleasantry.</p>

<p>To the secret denunciations of eavesdroppers the
king, unlike many of his royal contemporaries, never
listened, preferring to trust to his own eyes and ears
only. This manly straightforwardness inspired all
his actions, and was instrumental in causing him
to arrive at the truth and to do justice, and obtained
for him among the people, even in his lifetime, the
name of “the just.” The memory of his fame for
justice has survived to this day in the current
popular saying: “King Matthias is dead, justice has
fled!” Although as a soldier and statesman crafty
and full of expedients, and even loving disguise in
contact with his people, he never was treacherous
and deceitful. Poisoning and assassination did not
enter into his catalogue of expedients as it did into
the policy and practice of his contemporary, the
French king, Louis XI., or the Italian princes, the
Estes, Sforzas, the Borgias, and the popes them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>selves,
who employed both as a favorite means for
accomplishing political objects. All unclean means
were repugnant to his frank and knightly nature, as
was evinced by the following instance. While he was
engaged in war, in 1463, against George Podiebrad,
the Czech king, he was approached by a man who
offered to take George’s life in armed combat for a
reward of five thousand florins. The king, knowing
the difficulties of the enterprise, at once consented,
promising even a larger amount in case of success.
This man, after lurking for a long while about the
person of King George, despaired of being able to
carry out his fell design, for the king was surrounded
by the finest soldiers of the period, and to attack
him, under those circumstances, would have been
equivalent to forfeiting his own life. He therefore
proposed to King Matthias to remove the Czech
king by poison. The king indignantly refused to
profit by the assassin’s offer, proudly exclaiming:
“We are in the habit of fighting with arms and not
with poison!” At the same time he sent a message
to the Czech king putting him on his guard against
the attempt to take his life by poison, and cautioning
him not to partake of any food or drink unless it
was first tested by one of his trusty men.</p>

<p>With views like these it was natural that King
Matthias should not be accessible to any fear of
poison or assassination. It was secretly intimated
to him at one time that his courtiers intended mixing
poison with his food. Upon hearing this he exclaimed:
“Let no king ruling justly and lawfully
fear the poison and assassin’s dagger of his subjects.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>”
His capacity for government was particularly shown
in the right selection and thorough appreciation of
men, and in the independence which he always maintained.
This trait of character became at once evident
on his ascent to the throne. Being only fifteen
years of age he was deemed too young for the
burden of government, and a governor and state-councillors
were placed by his side. But he felt
equal to the duties of his royal office, and determined
to take the reins of government in his own
hands. In this scheme, however, he saw both his
friends and his enemies arrayed against him. The
former, the adherents of old Hunyadi, to whose services
he owed his throne, wished to superintend his
education, to guard him against dangers, and to
maintain at the same time their influence over him.
His enemies, on the other hand, true to the instincts
of their inveterate hostility to the Hunyadi family,
after having first opposed his aspirations to the
throne and afterwards intrigued against him, were
glad of an opportunity to balk him in his wishes,
and therefore they now sided against him, and soon
after openly declared for Frederic, the German emperor.</p>

<p>The position of the young king was an exceedingly
critical one; his foreign enemies, too, the
Turks, Germans, and Czechs, began open opposition
and, what was most discouraging of all, the treasury
was empty. But he surprised everybody by the
independence and circumspect conduct with which
he met both friends and foes, and also the difficulties
threatening from abroad. His astute questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
and ready replies in conversation were the theme
of universal admiration. It was thought that, being
a youth, he would busy himself with empty trifles,
and give little thought to his royal responsibilities.
His partisans had hoped to be called upon to instruct
him in the art of government, whilst his enemies
had anticipated that, unmindful of his kingly
duties, he would very soon be ruined. But he disappointed
both. In the council chamber he listened
attentively when any of the lords spoke, but as soon
as their views diverged and threatened to degenerate
into a heated discussion, it was he, the youth, whom
they had met to advise, who admonished them to be
calm and to agree. His enemies saw that the youth
was thoroughly conscious of the exaltedness of his
position, which placed him above his adherents as
well as his enemies, and they now tried every means
to create dissensions between him and his partisans.
In this they failed, for the king was on his guard.
Knowing his difficult position, he took pains to conciliate
his friends. In the treatment of them he was
both determined and smooth. In conversation he
first ascertained the views of those to whom he
spoke, and then shaped his own remarks accordingly.
He had the talent of persuading his antagonists
without seeming to do so, and of getting them to
share his views, and as he was quick to discover the
opinions of others, he was not liable to being imposed
upon. By slow degrees all opposition to him
died out and both friend and foe were silenced.</p>

<p>After disposing of his domestic antagonists, he
turned his attention to his enemies abroad, and, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
dint of an active mind, knowledge of men, polished
manner, and generosity, where it was needed, he
soon succeeded in strengthening his throne against
all enemies. One by one, the proud princes and oligarchs,
who had only reluctantly and disdainfully
accepted the sovereignty of the upstart, were conciliated
by his royal qualities, and under the rule of
Matthias, the son of Hunyadi, Hungary secured an
wider influence and a higher degree of power than
she had ever attained beneath the sceptres of the
descendants of the ancient kings.</p>

<p>An account has been previously given of the
splendor which the king’s embassies displayed
abroad, and we may add that Matthias was the
wealthiest and most luxurious ruler in all Europe.
He had enormous wealth at his disposal, composed
in part of his own private fortune, and in part of the
royal revenues. At that time there was generally
no distinction made between the revenues of the
king and those of the state. The king disposed of
all the sums flowing into the royal treasury, whether
derived from the state taxes or from any other
sources. King Matthias was quite proficient in the
art of turning to the fullest use these sources of
income, and of adding fresh ones, in case of need.
He introduced a more punctual and rigorous administration
of the finances with most admirable results.
He was himself also the possessor of a vast private
fortune, inherited from his father. His domains extended
for many miles, and he was the owner of mines
of gold and silver, of great productiveness, in the richest
mineral region of the country. None of his sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>jects
could compare with him as to the extent of
their private estates, although there were many
amongst the church and lay magnates who could
boast of immense wealth.</p>

<p>In his reign the royal revenues increased upon an
unprecedented scale. The aggregate annual income
of the Hungarian treasury amounted under King
Ladislaus V. to only about 120,000 florins. Under
Matthias it increased, on an average, tenfold. His
yearly income very soon exceeded one million, and
not unfrequently reached even two million florins,
and this at a period when the French king, who was
supposed to be the richest sovereign, was unable to
make his income reach one million. It is true Matthias
stood always in need of a great deal of money
to carry out his vast schemes, his soldiers and wars
swallowing up enormous sums; while it may be said,
he was also prone to indulge in all the luxuries
of life.</p>

<p>The time had passed when men’s whole lives were
divided between war and prayer only. Until now
these had been the essential characteristics of the
middle ages. But all this was suddenly changed;
people awoke to the consciousness of their wealth,
and there were several countries in Europe offering a
long list of varied enjoyments fit to tempt the most
fastidious. The arts, painting, sculpture, and skilful
working in precious metals, as well as the sciences,
began to flourish; and people began to read books,
books written by hand in elaborate manuscripts and
richly ornamented with gold and silver and the
most varied illuminated work. The classic authors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
of ancient Greece and Rome—long lost sight of—had
been rediscovered, and scattered memorials of
ancient art came to light, and were cherished by the
finders with the fresh delight of childhood enjoying
new playthings.</p>

<p>In this movement Italy occupied the front rank.
From his early youth Matthias was drawn by all the
fibres of his heart towards the awakening culture, the
motto of which was to enjoy the beautiful. How
thoroughly he entered into the spirit of the rising
glory of the new civilization, is best shown by the
fact that his Italian contemporaries praised him to
the skies as the whole-souled patron of science and
art. In the magnificence and the splendor with
which he surrounded himself, Matthias certainly exceeded
all his contemporaries, not even excepting
the Italian princes, who were famous for their sumptuousness
and their appreciation of works of art,
and of whom Matthias had, undoubtedly, learned a
good deal. The example set by the king influenced
his subjects, the chief prelates of the church, who
had obtained immense endowments from the first
kings of Hungary, and the proud and rich great
lords. But none of them could approach the king
in magnificence or in refined luxury. His court was
the gathering place of scholars and artists not only
from Hungary and Italy but from all Europe. To
them he assigned the highest places in the state,
in the church, and in the schools. From these
scholars he selected his chancellors and vice-chancellors,
his treasurers and sub-treasurers, the royal
councillors, his son’s tutor, men employed to read to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
him, his librarians, court historiographers and secretaries,
all of whom were munificently rewarded for
their services.</p>

<p>Nor was it necessary for a scholar to have a fixed
position at court in order to secure a rich income;
his very presence at court was supposed to give him
a valid title to a compensation. Theologians, philosophers,
poets, orators, jurists, physicians, and astronomers
came to admire the renowned court, and remained
there to add to its brilliancy, to amuse the
king, and to be the recipients of his munificence.
These men were treated by the king as his friends
and companions and led a comfortable, and, frequently,
a luxurious life. They had their abundant
share in the good cheer of the table, and in the pastimes
and honors. The frequent discussions of scientific
and literary questions, which arose in such
a circle, produced, especially when peaceful seasons
intervened for a time, a busy scholarly life at court,
of which the king, who was fond of taking part in
the conversations, was the bright centre. He was
himself proficient in the lore of his age. It is true
that his youthful education had not been completed,
for he had been left an orphan at a tender age, and
had soon been compelled to exchange the games of
youth for the cares of government, but his great
talents, his quickness, and the keen interest he took
in every thing, greatly contributed to make up for
any deficiency in precision of knowledge. He had a
retentive memory and rarely forgot what he heard in
conversation, and probably a large part of what he
learned came in this way. It was also the fashion at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
that time for scholars to prolong their discussions,
after the fashion of the Greek gymnasiums, from
morn until night, and to appoint special meetings
for special subjects. The subject under discussion
was pursued everywhere—at the table, during the
sports, in the reception room, the garden, and the
fields. The subjects were principally classical. Sometimes
lectures were delivered in the presence of the
king or queen, as in the instance of Bonafini, who
visited the court in 1487. In order to get better
acquainted with him and to present him to the
court, the king, who subsequently appointed him
his court historiographer, ordered him to deliver a
lecture at his palace, in Vienna, where he then happened
to hold his court. The whole court, together
with the foreign ambassadors, appeared on this interesting
occasion. At the conclusion of the lecture
the writings of Bonafini were brought in and distributed
amongst the chief prelates and the magnates.</p>

<p>The court dinners afforded favorable opportunities
for scholarly discussions and conversations. A great
number of guests had a permanent invitation to the
king’s table. Such were his near relatives, soldiers
of high rank, dignitaries of Church and State, foreign
ambassadors, and, especially, the scholars residing at
his court. In an atmosphere like this it was quite
natural that the discourse should take a lively turn,
and include in its range both serious and amusing
subjects. The king himself enjoyed a world-wide
fame for his ready wit and attractive talk. He
liked to propound riddles to his learned friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
and at times would give them a great deal of trouble
by his cleverly-contrived oracular questions, particularly
if he wished to confound some braggart. He
delighted in disputes, in which he was seldom
worsted, because he kept his temper to the last.
But in most cases the discussion was begun by his
guests—the king only joining in afterwards, and very
frequently giving the decision. Some of his puns
and anecdotes are remembered to this day. The
theme of one of these was decidedly of a convivial
nature. The discourse ran on eating, and the question
was mooted as to which was the best dish. The
king quoted the Hungarian proverb: “Nothing is
worse than cheese” (<i>Habere nihil est pejus caseo</i>).
This, of course, was denied by many, who maintained
that cucumbers, apricots, and many varieties
of fish were far worse than cheese. Every one was
amused when the king explained the double meaning
of the saying that “Nothing is worse than
cheese” being equivalent to “Cheese is better than
nothing.” It happened, however, often enough that
grave scientific propositions or Scriptural themes
were under discussion, and, on such occasions, the
king would send to his library for books calculated
to support the soundness of his statements or argument.</p>

<p>This library was the king’s chief glory and pride.
It contained on his accession to the throne but a few
volumes, but in the course of time it so increased
in the number of books as well as their value, that it
brought to the king even greater fame than his successes
on the battle-field—not only in the age he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
lived in, but during the ages that followed. Over
a hundred specimens of those books are still in existence,
and from these we can form an adequate
idea of its magnificence and richness. The library
was in the castle of Buda, and the place assigned
to it comprised two large halls, provided with windows
of artistically stained glass, opening into each
other. The entrance consisted of a semicircular hall
commanding a magnificent view of the Danube. Both
halls were provided with rich furniture. One of them
contained the king’s couch, covered with tapestry embroidered
with pearls, upon which he spent his leisure
hours reading. Tripod-shaped chairs covered with
carpet were placed about, recalling the Delphian
Apollo. Richly-carved shelves ran along the walls
and were curtained with purple-velvet tapestry, interwoven
with gold. It would be difficult to describe
properly the magnificence of the books themselves.
They were all written on white vellum and bound in
colored skins, ornamented with rose-diamonds and
precious stones and with the king’s portrait or his
arms. The pages are illuminated with miniature
paintings and ornaments, vying with each other in
excellence, and the work of some of the most famous
illuminators of the age. At the time of the
king’s death there were over 10,000 such volumes in
the library.</p>

<p>The king permanently employed at his court thirty
transcribers and book-painters, and also gave occupation
to Florentine and Venetian copyists and painters,
who sent the volumes when finished to Buda.
Although the art of printing had been already in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>vented,
yet its productions appeared so primitive
when compared with these splendid works of art, that
the collectors preferred having their books written
and painted by hand. It was, to be sure, much more
expensive. King Matthias spent over thirty thousand
florins annually on his library, a sum equivalent
in present currency to considerably over half a
million of florins. He lavished larger sums even on
architects, painters, sculptors, carvers, and goldsmiths.
A whole army of artists were kept busy at
his court, especially after his second marriage. During
the first years of his reign he was content with
the edifices and art memorials inherited from his
ancestors, but the arrival of the new queen entirely
changed the old modes of life. The habits of life
which had been familiar in Italy long ago, with
brilliancy, good taste, and wit in their train, were
now domesticated on the banks of the Danube. The
royal bride was a child of the sunny clime of Naples,
a city which was one of the first to foster the new
civilization. King Matthias had both the ambition
and the ability to effect such changes in the royal
residence, before the arrival of his bride, as would
make her feel at home in Buda. Long before the
new queen was to come, Buda presented a busy
scene. The royal palace was enlarged and embellished.
Its court-yards were beautified by bronze
statues and sculptured marble fountains, and the
ancient plastering gave way to porphyry and marble
columns. The sides of the staircases were ornamented
with frescoes, and from the niches statues of antique
style peeped at the passer-by. Costly new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
tapestry covered the walls, and splendid carpets
were spread on the floor of the wide vestibules,
stately halls, and roomy chambers, which were filled
with sumptuous furniture. The walls were hung
with paintings representing heroic events or themes
from ancient history or from the Scriptures. Modern
carved furniture took the place of the old pieces,
and every thing seemed to breathe a new life and to
be rejuvenated.</p>

<p>The vaults gave up their old treasures, and new
ones were added to the collections. Immense buffets
were groaning under the weight of silver and gold,
while antique gems, statuettes, and groups of vases
were displayed on small tables and in sideboards with
glass doors. The palace became a very museum of
exquisite objects of art. We can picture to ourselves
the vast main hall of the castle, with its peculiar
mediæval splendor and brilliancy, in which the
marriage took place in December, 1476. The walls
of the hall were tapestried with silk interwoven with
gold, and strewn with pearls and precious stones,
and over the table of the bridal pair a tapestry of
sheer gold came flowing down from the ceiling. In
the centre of the hall, in front of the king’s table,
stood a buffet with four faces, each side containing
eight shelves loaded down with enormous silver
pitchers, cans, goblets, tankards, amphores, and
glasses of every description. On this buffet, alone,
there were over five hundred vessels, besides two
unicorns, which ornamented the lowest shelf, and
which weighed seven hundred marks of silver. A
gigantic fountain of silver of artistic design, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
centre of the hall, spouted fiery wines. It was so
high that a tall man could hardly reach its top.
Near the fountain was a bread-basket of solid silver.
Further on, silver casks were suspended from the
ceiling dispensing various wines. The hall contained
eight more tables, and by each stood a buffet
weighed down by gold and silver vessels. Over nine
hundred vessels and plate of all kinds were arrayed
on the shelves of these buffets without being used.
The vessels and plate on the table of the royal couple
were all of pure and massive gold. Nor were the
other palaces or summer residences, in which the
court dwelt, inferior in splendor. The permanent
seat of the court was the castle of Buda, but it
was frequently shifted to Visegrád, Tata, Presburg,
and Vienna, everywhere displaying the same pomp
and sumptuousness. These royal residences appeared
like real fairy castles, with their hanging
gardens, fountains, fish-ponds, aviaries, game-parks,
small pleasure-houses, arbors, and statues. Visegrád,
became especially famous. One of the papal legates,
a man of taste and education, and a great lord, used
to sumptuous living, speaks of Visegrád, in a communication
to the Pope, as an earthly paradise
created anew by the hands of King Matthias.</p>

<span class="caption">JELLACHICH SQUARE, AGRAM.</span></a></div>

<p>Within this brilliant network of royal palaces pulsated
the busy court life, with a frequent exhibition
of exceptional gayeties and splendid feasts. The
court was always thronged with the relatives of the
king, with captains of the highest rank, and with
hundreds of courtiers, from the chancellor down to
the humble attendant, and great lords and high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
prelates, with their courtly trains, gathered around
the king, hoping for advancement of one kind
or other. The court was also a favorite resort for
foreign diplomatists, who came for the purpose of
settling questions relating to politics, church, or family
concerns, and delivering messages of respect and
homage to the king, whose strong arm was able to restrain
and check the Turks, the Germans, and the roving
bands of marauders. By degrees the Hungarian
court took on a European, or cosmopolitan air, becoming
more and more refined, gaining also the repute
of being a seat of classical learning and culture.
There was both compliment and truth in the remark
made to King Matthias by his antagonist, Uladis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>laus,
the Czech king, at one of the brilliant feasts
given by the former: “Your Majesty, it is difficult
to triumph over a king who is the possessor of so
much treasure.”</p>

<p>It was a great misfortune that Matthias died
without leaving a son to succeed him, for all the
accumulated splendor and culture vanished with the
king who had introduced and developed them. It
was at the zenith of his glorious career, while he
was pondering on far-reaching plans for the future,
that death surprised him. On Palm Sunday of the
year 1490 he attended divine service, and, on returning
from church, he was suddenly seized with
extreme lassitude. He at once called for figs.
They were brought, but on finding them mouldy,
he angrily rejected them. Soon after he was overcome
by dizziness, and a fit of an apoplectic character
deprived him of the power of speech and
memory. He expired on the 6th of April, after an
illness prolonged for two days.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br /><br />

<small>THE PERIOD OF NATIONAL DECLINE, AND THE
DISASTROUS BATTLE OF MOHÁCS.</small></h2>

<p>We are now approaching one of the darkest pages
in the history of Hungary. The nation which but
thirty-five years before had occupied a commanding
position in the world, had, within that short
space of time, sunk so low as to become merely a
bone of contention for foreign princes. The concluding
act of that sad era was the calamitous battle
fought on the field of Mohács, where were expiated
the many national sins which had brought
about this sorrowful state of things.</p>

<p>The period following the death of the great king
was marked by feeble rulers; by hierarchical chiefs,
unmindful of their duties; by an oligarchy acknowledging
no restraints; by a military organization rotten
to the core; and by discontented subjects. So
rapidly did the fame of the nation decline that we
find Erasmus of Rotterdam envying their king,
Louis, the possession, not of his kingdom, but of
an eminent teacher (Jacob Piso) then living there.
The power of the king was even at a lower ebb than
that of the nation. We find, for instance, John
Szapolyai (or Zápolya), the head of the oligarchy, dar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>ing
to attack King Uladislaus at the latter’s own
palace at Buda, in order to force from him the hand
of Anna, his daughter. King Louis, the successor
of Uladislaus, was told to his face by Thomas
Bakacs, one of his councillors, at a meeting of the
National Assembly, that, unless he acted according
to the wishes of his councillors, and listened to their
advice, they would drive him from the country,
and elect another king in his place. These incidents
clearly denote the character of the rulers, and
of the leading men of the nation, whose province it
was to defend the country against an enemy which
the great Hunyadis themselves had hardly been able
to withstand, namely, the Turkish power, and the
ruinous effects of their misrule became evident soon
enough. In rapid succession followed one loss of
territory after another, coupled with loss of prestige
abroad, and civil strife within, and shortly afterwards
came the crowning disgrace of the Turkish
yoke. It is but right to add that this melancholy
period was not quite barren of good men, who both
knew and strove to do their duty, and it will be a
grateful task to make honorable mention of these
noteworthy exceptions.</p>

<p>The partisans of four hostile candidates met on
the 17th of May, 1490, on the field of Rákos, for the
purpose of electing a king of Hungary. The National
Assembly, at that period, greatly resembled
the popular meetings held by the conquering Hungarians
under the Árpáds. They gathered on horseback,
numbering many thousands, on some extensive
plain, taking counsel with each other, or, rather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
listening to the utterances of their party leaders.
These assemblies continued their so-called deliberations
at times for many weeks, and their attendance
entailed no little expense to those taking part. Many
of them came with a large retinue of servants, and it
frequently happened that the poorer members, the
so-called middle, running short in provisions and
money, were compelled to leave for their homes before
the deliberations were concluded. This was
precisely what happened on the present occasion.
The powerful magnates purposely wasted time by
delaying the deliberations, and thus compelled the
smaller gentry to withdraw. Before leaving, however,
these last elected sixty members from their
number, who were to remain as representatives, but
it was of no avail, for their party was defeated, owing
to the withdrawal of such large numbers. This
time the stratagem of the oligarchy proved more successful
than at the former election, when, as we have
seen, the impatient smaller gentry, who were greatly
in the majority, succeeded in electing their candidate,
Matthias Hunyadi.</p>

<p>Of the several candidates, John Corvinus, the son
of King Matthias, had few adherents and many enemies.
It was accounted a crime in him that he was
not descended from a queenly mother. Beatrice, the
widowed queen, was especially opposed to his election.
She could not bear the idea of her husband’s
son ascending the throne. She flattered herself, besides,
with the hope of being able to retain her regal
position by the election of a prince who would make
her his queen. With this view she became the parti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>san
of Maximilian, the son of the emperor of Germany,
and advanced his interests with the passionate vehemence
characteristic of the Italian blood which ran
in her veins. Her partiality for the imperial prince,
however, soon gave way to feelings of disdain, upon
being addressed by him, in one of his letters, as his
“dear mother,” and she transferred her affections to
Ladislaus (styled by the Hungarians, Uladislaus),
king of Bohemia. Her new favorite was descended,
through the female line, from the Árpáds. The
wealthy and influential magnates were also on his
side, but with them the fact chiefly weighed in his
favor that he was understood to be a kind-hearted,
gentle, and feeble prince, whom it would be easy
for them to govern. Both Báthory and the oligarchy
wanted no king but a royal tool. Albert, the brother
of Uladislaus, was the fourth aspirant for royal
honors.</p>

<p>The States-General not being able to agree upon
any one of the candidates, they at last resolved that
he who should obtain the vote of Szapolyai, governor
of Vienna, should become king. This decision greatly
elated the party of John Corvinus, for as soon as
they learned that the election of their candidate depended
upon Szapolyai’s decision, they felt assured
of his triumph. They could expect no less of the
man who, from having been twenty years ago a common
trooper—at Visegrád—had been raised to his
present exalted position by King Matthias. Szapolyai
received in Vienna the deputation which had
come to invite him to elect the king. In the consciousness
of his power, the proud upstart lifted up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
his little boy, who afterwards became king of Hungary,
and placing him upon his knee, said: “Wert
thou, my boy, but that tall, I would make thee king
of Hungary.” This unscrupulous man was not inclined
to obey a master, and, knowing that he himself
had no chance of royalty, he preferred a weak
king, such as he believed Uladislaus to be, and, in
consideration of a large reward, he sold to him the
throne.</p>

<p>The result of the election greatly disappointed and
surprised the middle classes. John Corvinus himself
was at first at a loss how to act, but finally determined
to retire to the southern part of the country
and to take with him the crown of St. Stephen,
which was in his hands. Six thousand men ready
to do battle for his cause accompanied him, and an
occasion for the display of their zeal soon presented
itself through the treachery of Stephen Báthory and
Paul Kinizsy. These faithless favorites of the late
King Matthias had promised him, on his deathbed,
to stand by his son, and now, instead of redeeming
their sacred obligation, they turned traitors to the
cause they had vowed to defend. They were the
first to assail the son they had promised to support.
They came up with him in the county of
Tolna, scattered his troops, and not only took from
him the crown, but robbed him also of his personal
treasures. John Corvinus himself became afterward
reconciled to the new order of things, and, at the
coronation, it was he who presented the crown to
his more fortunate rival. A deputation was sent to
Uladislaus, to invite him to the throne of Hungary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
He received them most graciously, kissing each of
them in turn, and crying with joy. In the month of
August the newly elected king made his triumphal
entry into Buda, accompanied by a gayly dressed
cavalcade, and no one could have anticipated that
the brilliant pageantry displayed on that occasion
would be followed so soon by a series of humiliations
terminating in a national tragedy.</p>

<p>The remaining rival candidates, however, were not
disposed to consider their cause as lost. Each of
them wanted his share of the kingdom, which was
now become an easy prey to its neighbors, and the
borders of Hungary on the east and west were simultaneously
crossed by enemies. A few months had
hardly elapsed since the death of Matthias, the great
king, and Albert, Duke of Poland, brother to Uladislaus,
was already laying waste the country to the
east as far as Erlau (Eger), while the horsemen of
Maximilian were tramping at Stuhlweissenburg over
the grave of Matthias, and making booty of his
treasures. Uladislaus remained inactive in the face
of these outrages committed by Maximilian. He
finally concluded a most humiliating peace (which
to him seemed advantageous), by the terms of which
all the former conquests of Matthias were to revert
to Maximilian. The true patriots blushed at the
news of the disgraceful treaty, and all the comfort
they could obtain from the king was his favorite
ejaculation, “Dobzse, dobzse.” (It is all well, it is
all well.)</p>

<p>Whilst the country was pursuing its downward
course, the Czech attendants of the king were inces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>sant
in their clamors against poor Hungary. They
complained that if they did not wish to starve they
would soon have to leave the country. The king
himself had not money enough at his disposal to
provide for the ordinary expenses of the royal household.
And yet the taxes were as high, and even
higher, than during the reign of Matthias; nay, the
chronicles of the time tell us that the people were
better off under that Matthias who arbitrarily imposed
taxes, than now under Uladislaus. In truth,
the many burdens which were now weighing down
the people were owing to the desire of many in high
places to enrich themselves. The disorders of the
time afforded a rare opportunity of doing so with
impunity. It happened, though, at times, that the
mismanagement of such greedy men would leak out,
as in the case of Lukács, bishop of Csanád, and Sigismund
Hampr, bishop of Fünfkirchen (Pécs), who
were both treasurers of the realm, and whose fraudulent
transactions were discovered. But the king was
too weak to visit their crimes with condign punishment,
and amongst the great of the land none were
disposed to throw the first stone at the criminals.
The impotence of the king caused the decline of the
national strength, the ruin of the finances, and, as a
natural consequence, the complete disorganization of
the military institutions.</p>

<p>In this connection we have to record a strange
encounter which took place in 1492 in the vicinity
of Halas, in the county of Pesth. Paul Kinizsy, the
terror of the Turks, the general who had grown gray
on victorious battlefields, met there, in hostile array,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
the army he himself had formerly commanded, the
famous “Black Guard” of Matthias. This very
army, with their brave old leader, had a few months
earlier repulsed the Turks near Szörény. After this
victory the soldiers demanded the pay which had
long been in arrears. As usual on such occasions,
tumults and disorders broke out in consequence of
this failure to keep faith with the troops. The wisdom
of the Hungarian National Assembly knew no
better remedy than to instruct Kinizsy to march
against the exasperated men. The old general
obeyed orders. Seven thousand men were massacred,
and the remainder, flying to Austria, dragged
out their weary lives as robbers, constantly at war
with the law. This cruel and impolitic measure deprived
the nation, at a time when she was preparing
for the life-and-death struggle against the formidable
power of the Turks, of one of her main supports, in
destroying that army which alone could have saved
her. For Kinizsy, the former miller-boy, this was
the last campaign, for very soon after he was stricken
with paralysis and deprived of the power of speech.
His contemporaries saw in this a punishment decreed
by Providence for the part he had played on that
bloody occasion.</p>

<p>The better part of the nation soon grew restless
under this state of things, and a party arose which
was hostile to the king. Stephen Verböczy was the
leader of the new party. He was a thorough patriot
and a skilled jurist, well versed in legislation. He
was highly esteemed by the middle class, in whom
he saw the only element which would restore to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
country the universal respect she formerly enjoyed.
This party aspired to the government of the land,
and their choice of a ruler fell on Stephen Szapolyai,
the son of John Szapolyai. If Stephen had not
been, in 1490, still a child, his father would then
have made him king. That he should become
king was the highest ambition of his mother Anna,
Duchess of Teschen, a woman more ambitious even
than her son, and of whom it is said that she invariably
concluded her daily devotions with a special
prayer to God, asking that she might be permitted
to live to see her son ascend the Hungarian throne.
Szapolyai himself did not consider it an arduous
task to accomplish this, for he argued that it was a
precedent in his favor that Matthias, who was of no
more exalted origin than himself, had become king.
His partisans first tried to attain their end by marriage,
and with this view Szapolyai asked of Uladislaus
the hand of the young Duchess Anna. Uladislaus
refused to accede to his request, and sought protection
against the vaulting ambition of the national
candidate in an alliance with the emperor Maximilian.
The idea of a treaty of marriage between
the two reigning dynasties was broached. The
national party answered by convoking the National
Assembly on the field of Rákos and passing the
important law that, in case of the extinction of the
male branch of the dynasty, they would elect a
native king only. In the meanwhile Szapolyai renewed
his wooing, and he was all the more confident
of accomplishing his object, as Uladislaus was then
seriously sick and still remained without any male<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
issue. But Uladislaus could not be moved to reconsider
his refusal. He told Szapolyai that he trusted
to God that he would recover his health, and that a
male child might yet be born to him. Nor was he
disappointed in his hopes. He regained his health,
and shortly afterwards his queen bore him a boy
who reigned, at a subsequent date, under the title of
Louis II.</p>

<p>Uladislaus now perceived the bearing of the Rákos
resolution and, in consequence, entered into a new
treaty with Maximilian. Under its terms Ferdinand,
a grandson of Maximilian, was to marry Uladislaus’
daughter Anna, whilst another grandchild of Maximilian,
Mary, was betrothed to Louis, the boy just
born. By virtue of this treaty Ferdinand, Archduke
of Austria, took possession of the throne of Hungary
after the fatal day of Mohács. This new alliance,
however, did not deter Szapolyai from his bold purpose.
Twice again he tried to gain Anna’s hand,
forcing his way into the presence of Uladislaus, but it
was all in vain. His partisans now began to meditate
the policy pursued by them later on, namely,
to resort to Turkish friendship for assistance. The
present state of things had become so intolerable,
that the national party recoiled from no measures,
however extreme, to bring about a change. One
day a wicked hand sped two balls into the palace of
Uladislaus; the king escaped, but to this day the
suspicion of the foul deed rests on the adherents of
Szapolyai.</p>

<p>The desperate contentions of the two parties gave
frequent rise to lawlessness and stormy scenes. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
nobility laid waste each other’s estates and often even
took unlawful possession of them. In this way many
a castle which John Corvinus had inherited from his
father passed at that time into the hands of Szapolyai.
Duke Ujlaky ventured even to molest the royal domains,
and upon being called to account for this by
the king, Ujlaky disdainfully styled him an ox. The
offended king, in order to avenge this affront, sent an
army against him under the lead of Bertalan Drágfy,
the vayvode of Transylvania, with the message that
the king’s second horn was now growing, and that
henceforth the king would fight his unruly subjects
with two horns. Szapolyai, the palatine of the kingdom,
offered to intercede; the intercession, however,
being nothing but a cloak to incite the people to
rebellion against Uladislaus, the latter was compelled
to yield, and to pardon Ujlaky. A most disgraceful
brawl, such as is usually witnessed only amongst the
drunken rabble, took place in the very presence of
the king in the royal council-chamber. George Szalkán,
the primate of Hungary, allowed himself to be
carried away, during a heated discussion with Christopher
Frangepán, to such an extent as to seize the
latter by the beard, whereupon he was struck in the
face by Frangepán. The king, by personally interfering,
put an end to these most unparliamentary proceedings.</p>

<p>A dangerous movement was at this time gaining
strength throughout Europe. The peasantry, weary
of the servitude in which they were held, resorted to
arms against their former oppressors. In Hungary,
especially, this movement assumed ominous propor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>tions.
The rebellion broke out in 1514, and was commonly
called either the Kurucz rebellion, from the
fact that those who took part in it were originally
intended to be soldiers of the cross (cruciferi), or,
after the name of their leader, the Dózsa rebellion.</p>

<p>Julius II., one of the most distinguished popes, died
at Rome in 1513. Amongst the aspirants to the
papal see we find a Hungarian archbishop, Thomas
Bakacs. He is said to have spent fabulous sums in
the eternal city to further his object. In order to
ingratiate himself with the populace he had his
horses’ feet shod with silver shoes, but so loosely
that they were dropped on the road and picked up
by the people. Being unsuccessful at the papal election,
he begged of the new pope, Leo X., to be
allowed, as a solace for his disappointment, to organize
a crusade against the Turks on his return to Hungary.
The arrival of Bakacs was the signal for a fierce
struggle in the ranks of the Diet. A portion of the
oligarchy, who hoped to derive some profit from this
venture, warmly advocated his scheme, while by
others, who were too much burdened already, it was
violently opposed. Stephen Telegdy, the keeper of
the treasure, stood at the head of the latter and
threw the whole weight of his authority into the
scale in order to prevent the passing of the law sanctioning
the crusade. He vividly pictured the miserable
condition of the peasantry, and resolutely objected
to providing them with arms, saying that it would be
equivalent to arming their own enemies. The law
was passed in spite of this remonstrance, and the
crusade was proclaimed on the 16th of July, 1514.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<p>The condition of the Hungarian peasants at that
period was a most wretched one. Those who inhabited
the border were beggared by the incessant plundering
expeditions of the Turks, while the remainder fared
hardly better at the hands of their lords. Their
masters were always in need of large sums of money
to cover their enormous expenditures. A German
contemporary, who lived for some time in Hungary,
wrote of the landed gentry that they were in the
habit of spending whole nights in riotous living, and
passing the days with sleeping off the effects of their
nocturnal orgies. The money required for this mode
of life had to be wrung from the hard labor of the
poor peasant, who was also weighed down by other
burdens. The Hungarian nobility enjoyed privileges
only; their shoulders knew no burdens. It
was the peasantry who paid all the taxes, who had
to pay out of their hard-earned farthings tithes to
support the clergy; and over and beyond all this,
they had to provide for their lords and masters.
The peasant had to till the soil if he did not wish to
starve, and in time of war he was compelled to ransom
himself from military service. Against oppressions
on the part of his lord he had no remedy,
for his master was his judge. The lords’ tribunal sat
in judgment over the peasant, and it can be easily
imagined what kind of justice was meted out to him.</p>

<p>Such was the sad condition of the peasantry when
the crusade was proclaimed. No wonder that the
oppressed peasants flocked in great numbers into
the camps ready to exchange the abject drudgery
of their daily life for the perils of crusading. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
large portion of the nobility were from the first
arrayed against this movement, all the more so as it
happened during the season when there was most
work to do in the field, and it was very difficult for
them to get along without the laborers. The peasants
looked with indifference upon the distress of their masters,
and deserted them in daily increasing numbers to
take up the holy cross. Bakacs had already provided
a leader for them, singling out for that position a
simple gentleman from Transylvania. His name was
George Dózsa, a name which, coupled with a doubtful
fame, will, nevertheless, continue to figure for all
times in the history of his country. Hungarian historians
of our days are fond of ascribing to him high
and patriotic schemes, and love to portray him as a
hero in the cause of liberty and one animated by a
lofty spirit. Yet, if we attentively scan his actions,
we are compelled to admit that he was little better
than a brave and desperate peasant, whose whole conduct
proves him to have bitterly hated the nobility.
Nor was he indebted to any great qualities for the
distinction he had won. His chief merit consisted
in being a bold man, of a fine and martial appearance,
in possessing a voice fit for command, and
in having a few years before, in a skirmish, cleft in
twain a Turkish pasha. The officers placed under
him were for the most part poor nobles like himself,
together with a few citizens from Pesth, and a
certain Lawrence Mészáros, a priest from Czegléd.
In a few days there were collected at the camp of
Pesth no less than 40,000 men, who were to be
marched against the Turks. But the army did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
need to go so far to find an enemy—namely, their
old oppressors, their Hungarian masters. The more
hot-headed amongst the peasants were haranguing
the others with vehemence, exciting their passions.
Their chief, Dózsa, was himself swept into
the new movement. Bakacs himself became terror-stricken
at the direction things were taking. He
called upon Dózsa to lead the army to their
place of destination, and as the latter hesitated to
obey, he was placed by this high church dignitary
under the ecclesiastical ban. Dózsa, in answer to
the archbishop’s anathema, changed his programme,
and led his men against the nobility. The struggle
was short but bitter. It was fear rather than the
badly armed troops of peasants that, at first, defeated
the great nobles. As soon as the first shock was
over, every member of the nobility felt that to avoid
the general ruin of all, they must stand together, in a
well organized force. They gathered under the leadership
of Stephen Báthory, the chief Comes (count) of
Temes, and Nicholas Csáky, bishop of Csanád, but
were destined to meet with yet another defeat. The
cruelties then perpetrated by the blood-thirsty peasantry
beggar all description. They overran the
whole country, burning one castle after another, and
massacred, by the light of the flames, all the noblemen
with their families who were so unfortunate as to fall
into their hands. Stephen Telegdy, who had so
vehemently opposed the crusade, himself lost his
life in this shocking manner, and Nicholas Csáky was
captured on the battle-field, and was, to the delight
of the whole camp, killed with torture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>Dózsa now proceeded to lay siege to Temesvár.
He had singled out this fortified place as the point
from which he would conquer the country for his
peasants, but at this very spot he had to learn by
painful experience that it was not an easy task to
cope with the established power, no matter how demoralized
for the time it be. The factions, admonished
by the common peril, ceased for the time their
party strife, and the chief Comes of Temes, a partisan
of the king, did not hesitate to invoke the support
of John Szapolyai, the vayvode of Transylvania,
who was the leader of the national party. The vayvode,
together with a strong force of the yeomanry
of Transylvania, came to his assistance, and the
struggle soon approached its termination. At the
first engagement the army of Dózsa was utterly defeated,
those who survived were scattered, and the
leader with a few of his companions was taken captive.
The savage work of retaliation now followed.
The vayvode Szapolyai was the president of the
tribunal. The victory he had achieved raised his
authority with the nobility, who looked upon the
late struggle as a war waged for their extermination,
and he thought it would add to his glory if he
presented to the excited nobles a harrowing spectacle.
Mercy was shown only to Gregory, the brother
of George Dózsa, inasmuch as he was merely beheaded.
The remaining rebel leaders, including Dózsa, were
thrown into prison, and were not permitted to taste
any food for a fortnight. Nine of them still remained
amongst the living. Dózsa was seated on a red
hot iron throne, a red hot crown was placed on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
forehead, and a red hot sceptre forced into his hand.
Not a murmur of pain escaped him during this
dreadful torture. Only when his famished companions
in arms rushed upon him and tore the charred
flesh from his body to appease their craving for food,
he exclaimed: “These hounds are of my own training.”
This was the end of one of the episodes of
this sanguinary domestic war. Four months of civil
strife had cost the country the lives of 50,000 men.
At a future period, not very distant, the nation
might have made a much better use of these lives,
but there seemed to be a fatality impelling the people
to become their own destroyers. The Hungarian
popular feeling has always sympathized with
the peasantry in this bloody rebellion. Thus the
story is, to this day, current amongst the people,
that, as often as the Lord’s body was raised, during
mass, Szapolyai became maddened for a few minutes,
because by his deeds he had rendered himself unworthy
of beholding the sacred host. History, on
the other hand, still cherishes the names of John
Gosztonyi, bishop of Raab, and Gotthard Sükey, a
captain from Pápa, of whom it is recorded that in
order to scatter the peasantry with as little bloodshed
as possible they loaded their guns with grass and
rags instead of cannon balls. The 50,000 victims,
however, did not suffice to appease the vindictive
spirit of the victors, for in their opinion the crimes
of the peasantry called for a sterner expiation. The
crime of the fathers must be visited on all generations
to come. The Diet, which met on the 18th of
October, 1514, seemed to think that the peasants had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
been treated too mildly, and that all of them deserved
death. The wise fathers of the land reflected, however,
that if all were exterminated no one would be
left to work for the nobles and to provide them with
food and drink. They therefore let mercy prevail—but
mercy as they understood it was the most refined
cruelty. The peasants were to be allowed to
live, but their life should become a calamity to them.
The perpetual servitude of the peasantry was proclaimed,
and it was ordained that they should be
chained down to the soil.</p>

<p>This iniquitous law was passed and sanctioned by
the king on the 19th of November, on the same day
that he confirmed the celebrated <i>tripartite code</i> compiled
by Stephen Verböczy, the Chief-Justice of the
land. Truly a most remarkable contrast in legislation.
On the one hand, a code which established
law and order in the kingdom; on the other hand,
the most inhuman measure in European history
dictated by savage vindictiveness. Verböczy’s tripartite
code, or, as its title runs, “Decretum <i>tripartitum
juris consuetudinarii</i>,” is the most famous and
the most important work of Hungarian jurisprudence,
shedding also an interesting light on the social condition
of the country at a remoter period. The
<i>tripartitum</i> is a strong advocate of the privileges and
immunities of the nobility. It establishes equal
rights for all the members of the Hungarian nobility,
acknowledging no difference between them except
on grounds of personal merit. Every Hungarian
noble accordingly was entitled to the privileges
accorded to the whole body; he could not be de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>prived
of his liberty without due conviction; above
him there was but one lord and master, and that was
the king, and he was exempt from taxation. It
further limits the authority of the clergy over lay
nobles, and denies the right of the Pope to the disposal
of church benefices. After endeavoring in this
manner to claim for the nobles independence as to
those above them, the code at the same time tries
to enlarge their rights as to those below them. The
recent uprising of the peasantry offered a good opportunity
for this tendency. It says: “The recent
rebellion, aimed, under the pretext of a crusade,
against the whole nobility, and led by a robber chief,
has, for all days to come, put the stain of faithlessness
on the peasants, and they have thereby forfeited
their liberty and become subject to their landlords
in unconditional and perpetual servitude. The peasant
has no sort of right over his master’s land save
bare compensation for his labor and such other reward
that he may obtain. Every species of property
belongs to the landlords, and the peasant has no
right to invoke justice and the law against a noble.”
This was the view taken by the nobility at that
period, a view which they succeeded in forcing upon
the feeble king.</p>

<p>The king, indeed was indifferent to the political
and social changes which injured the best interests
of the nation. His main purpose was to secure the
throne to his family, and as long as he succeeded in
this all the rest was “<i>dobzse</i>” to him. He had his
sickly son crowned when he was but an infant of two
years, and obtained for him the powerful protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
of the imperial family. In 1506 his queen, Anna of
Candal, an intelligent and energetic woman, the
niece of Louis XI., King of France, died. The sorrow
of the widowed king was boundless; for days
he remained in his rooms weeping and moaning.
Ten years later he followed the queen he had so
much mourned, and his son, Louis II., succeeded
him. Louis was a mere boy, but ten years old,
when he ascended the throne, and his youth was another
misfortune to the weakened and divided country.
The events of his reign are usually summed up
in one sentence: “He was prematurely born, married
young, ascended the throne young, and died
young.” We shall, however, devote a larger space
to this kind-hearted but unfortunate youth. Louis,
as was stated, came prematurely into the world, and
it required all the skill the medical science of the
time afforded to keep alive the royal infant, who
hardly breathed when he was ushered into the world.
For weeks he was kept lying in the warm carcasses
of animals slaughtered and cut open for that purpose,
and in this manner was saved from death.
But little attention was paid to his education during
his father’s life; it is reported that at a later period
he blamed the latter for his neglect, and strove hard
by redoubled exertions to make up for lost time.
Although prematurely born he developed quite
early in life, and was a tall and strong youth at the
time his father died. Cardinal Thomas Bakacs, John
Bornemisza, the castellan of Buda, and George of
Brandenburg, Margrave of Anspach, were, by the
king’s last will, appointed his guardians. George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
became the ruin of the ambitious young king. The
good lessons taught him by Jacob Piso, his excellent
teacher, were set at naught by this guardian.
He was not actuated by sinister motives in spoiling
his ward; his conduct was the effect rather of
a life-long habit of riotous living, of which he
could not divest himself, and it was no wonder that
the youthful king was quick to imitate the unworthy
example. The more serious studies soon gave way
to amusements of all kinds, and the boy-king spent
his life in riding, hunting, and feasting, as long as his
means would allow. Some of the frolicsome eccentricities
recorded of him best illustrate his giddiness.
He had among his courtiers a man named Peter
Korogi, whose indestructible stomach was far-famed
for its utter want of squeamishness. It was his great
delight to summon before him Korogi, and see him
devour living mice, cats’ tails, carrion found in the
streets, and inkstands with the ink in them. Poor
Korogi lost his life afterwards at the battle of
Mohács.</p>

<p>A glance at Louis’ court and at his personal surroundings
will suffice to give us a picture of the
condition of the country. Uladislaus had already
repeatedly complained that but a small
portion of the revenues of the state ever
reached his hands, and that his income during
three years did not amount to as much as
King Matthias used to spend on his clerks. Louis,
who, besides, had to defray the expenses of his education,
fared infinitely worse. He had to put off
from day to day his journey to Prague, the capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
of his Bohemian kingdom, because he was unable
to procure the funds necessary for his travelling
expenses. Things came to such a pass that the
king could not provide decently for the royal
table, which was all the more unfortunate for him,
as he boasted of an excellent appetite; his contemporaries
relating of him that when his resources
permitted, seven meals were daily served at
his court. His penury finally reached such a point
that he lacked the means of paying the wages of his
household servants, and then it was that a certain
sum was set apart for royal expenses, to be paid into
the hands of the treasurer and not of the king, a
contrivance which was of little avail, the treasurers
themselves being untrustworthy. King Louis remained
as poor as he was before, and we read that
at a reception given to the ambassadors of foreign
powers, where the most brilliant display would have
been in place, the young king sat on his throne in
dilapidated boots. In spite of his poverty Louis
found a way to indulge in pastimes and to squander
money. At a time when they write of him that he
could not call a sound pair of boots his own, he remitted
to one of his courtiers a debt of 40,000 ducats
in exchange for a trained falcon. George of Brandenburg
wrote on one occasion that although the court
was dreadfully poor, yet they managed to carouse
all the time. These entertainments were marked by
scenes and occurrences which but ill comport with
the dignity of a court. The king was excessively
fond of amusements, and on one occasion he wrote
three months before the carnival: “Wherever we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
shall happen to be, even on a journey, we intend to
make merry and to pass gayly our days.” The carousing
at the court, however, was not confined to the
carnival season, for we read that on the very eve of
the battle of Mohács, the king and queen were enjoying
themselves right royally. The queen, too,
was fond of gayeties. No one would have foretold
of her that she should ever become so versed in
matters of state. The difference between Mary
the queen and Mary the widow might well elicit
universal surprise. The eventful battle of Mohács
sobered her. While her husband lived she so freely
entered into the pastimes and frolics of the king that
the partisans of the king himself were compelled to remind
her more than once of the rules of decency and
propriety.</p>

<p>A fierce struggle ensued between the oligarchical
and the national party as to who should be selected
for the royal council. This rivalry sprang by no
means from patriotic motives, or from a desire to
serve the country in the royal councils, but from the
more sordid aim of making use of the royal authority
to extend and increase their personal power and influence.
The party leaders were still the same. Szapolyai
and Verböczy stood at the head of the middle-class
party, whilst the royal party, led by Báthory,
made common cause with the Fuggers. The Fuggers
were the Rothschilds of the sixteenth century;
they had amassed immense wealth in Hungary by
advancing at first an inconsiderable sum to the king,
and obtaining for it the privilege of working the
mines. They fraudulently exported from the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
all the gold and silver obtained from the mines,
while of the money advanced by them but very little
got into the king’s hands, as it had first to pass the
hands of middle-men, who managed to keep large
portions. In this way can it be accounted for that
Thomas Bakacs’ household was far more lavish and
brilliant than that of the king himself, and that Count
Alexius Thurzó, being in collusion with the Fuggers,
was enabled at one time to advance to the king
32,000 florins. Emeric Szerencs’ name figures most
conspicuously amongst these money manipulators.
He was a converted Jew, occupying a prominent
position, and who subsequently became treasurer of
the state. While he was never able to procure
money for the treasury, he succeeded in constantly
adding immense sums to his own fortune. The people
at last rose against the unscrupulous treasurer,
and attacked Szerencs in his own palace. He saved
himself only with great difficulty from the fury of
the populace by escaping through a window to which
a rope ladder was attached.</p>

<p>The party of the nobility was at last victorious.
At the Diet assembled at Hatvan 14,000 nobles assumed
such a menacing attitude towards the government
that all its members were compelled to
give in their resignations, and Stephen Verböczy
was elected by the triumphant party palatine of
the kingdom. John Szapolyai became treasurer.
To what extent the treasury was better managed
under his direction it would be difficult to determine,
for the sad fact remained that the treasury
still remained empty, and that the new treasurer was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
constantly adding to the number of his estates and
increasing his domain. The magnates as well as the
burghers clearly saw that nothing had been gained
by the change effected in the administration. They
therefore combined to restore the former government,
and were headed by the great nobles who
had been deprived of their offices—Báthory, the
late palatine, and Alexius Thurzó. The league is
known in Hungarian history under the name of the
“<i>Kalandos</i>” Society—the word “kalandos” having in
the Magyar language the meaning of “adventurous,”
but in truth the word was derived from the “<i>Kalends</i>,”
the society being in the habit of meeting on the “Kalends,”
or first of each month. This patriotic band
of would-be saviors of their country went on with
their intrigues even after the news had arrived of another
Turkish inroad threatening the country. The
league at last succeeded. At the Diet convoked in
Buda they reinstated their party in power. Verböczy
himself was not slow in perceiving that he had been
used by Szapolyai merely as a tool, and, refusing to be
an instrument in his hands, he resigned the dignity of
which he had been already deprived by the Diet. In
order to save his life he fled to Transylvania, but he
could not prevent the Diet from declaring him to be
an enemy to his country.</p>

<p>Báthory occupied again his former position of a
palatine, and announced his programme in these
brief words: “We are not the cause of the ruin of
the country”—a very strange assurance on the part
of the councillors and leading statesmen of Louis II.,
coming too at a time when they were menaced on all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
sides by approaching perils. This conduct occasioned
the papal nuncio’s remark that “they were playing
comedy with their mutual protests.”</p>

<p>The Reformation added a new complication to the
many dividing the nation, being a fresh source of
discord amongst the people. This mighty religious
movement spread as far as Hungary about the same
time that it had won a large territory for itself in
Germany. Here as there its adherents met with
persecutions at the hand of the Roman Catholic
Church. The new faith, although it had not gained
large numbers, soon found its martyrs in the country.
Both of the political factions were equally guilty
of these persecutions, and we find a telling proof of
this in the fact that Verböczy as well as Báthory,
the respective palatines of the hostile parties, each
had his share in the executions of the Protestants
who laid down their lives for their faith. While
Hungarian blood was thus shed by the Hungarians
themselves, their proud neighbor, Sultan Selim, the
mighty ruler of the Turkish empire, had registered
a vow before Allah, in case he would vouchsafe victory
to his armies over Persia, to build for his worship
three magnificent mosques—one in Jerusalem,
another in Buda, and a third in Rome. The sultan
vanquished the Persians, but was prevented by death
from fulfilling his vow. In Hungary they made
merry, drinking death to the Turks, and little
dreaming that the new sultan was destined to inflict
upon them soon a most deadly blow.</p>

<p>Solyman the Magnificent succeeded the fierce Selim.
He combined in his person the talents of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
great warrior, a great legislator, and a great theologian.
It was not long before the Hungarians themselves
offered him an excuse for waging war against
them. On his accession to the throne he had sent
an ambassador to Louis II. for the purpose of prolonging
the peace between them. The overbearing
Hungarian nobles did not so much as enter into a
parley with the envoy, but threw him into prison,
dragged him with them all over the country, and
finally, after cutting off his nose and ears, sent him
back to his master. This dire offence against the
law of nations, and the unprovoked insult to the sultan
in the person of his representative, could not
be left unpunished. Solyman swore he would be
avenged for this affront, and vowed he would get
possession of that Belgrade which at one time had
maintained its independence against the warlike
genius of a Mohammed II. “He attacked simultaneously
two of the strongest border fortresses—Shabatz
and Belgrade. The king was just then too
busy with his wedding with the Austrian princess
Mary to allow himself to be disturbed by the hostile
inroad, nor did his chief councillors take any heed
of it. Báthory, the palatine of the kingdom, was
also celebrating his nuptials, whilst Chancellor Szalkay’s
attention was entirely absorbed by the administration
of the bishopric of Erlau that had been recently
bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>Shabatz stood under the command of Simon Logody
and Andrew Torma, both men of great heroism
and rare courage. They shone out as conspicuous
exceptions in this corrupt age. They preferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
to face certain death rather than save themselves by
deserting the fortress entrusted to their care, and
solemnly swore to be true to the cause of the country
unto death. They and their brave garrison kept
their oaths faithfully; of five hundred men, but sixty
were left on the 16th day of the siege. These sixty
men were drawn up in soldierly array on the public
square of the fort to receive the last assault of
the Turkish army, and not one of them escaped
with his life. Six weeks later Belgrade, the famous
scene of Hungarian heroism, was taken by the
Turks, and it is not often that an enemy achieved
as easy a victory over such a stronghold as this
border fortress as the Turks secured on the 29th of
August, 1521. Francis Hedervári and young Valentine
Törok had been entrusted with the defence of
Belgrade. These selfish nobles, unmindful of their
sacred duties, left Belgrade and proceeded to Buda,
in order to obtain from the government repayment
for the expenses already incurred by them for the
maintenance of the fortress. Failing in their errand,
they did not return to their trust, but left the garrison,
numbering seven thousand men, to themselves,
under the command of their subordinate officers, the
brave Blasius Oláh, and the treacherous Michael
Moré. Their desertion sealed the fate of this fortress.
Moré became a traitor to the cause of his
country; he deserted to the enemy’s camp, and, betraying
to the Turks the weak points of the stronghold,
he endeavored, at the same time, to prevail
upon Oláh to aid him in his wicked designs. The
patriotism of the latter, however, was proof against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
all the allurements of the tempter. The fall of the
fortress was, nevertheless, unavoidable. The number
of the garrison had dwindled down to seventy-two
men, when a squabble ensued between those of them
who were Hungarians and those who were Servians,
which ended in their compelling Oláh to surrender
the fortress. By the terms of the surrender the garrison
was allowed to leave the fortress unmolested,
but the Turks interpreted this clause in their own
way. They were permitted to march into the Turkish
camp, but on their wishing to leave the camp
they were all of them massacred.</p>

<p>The fall of Belgrade spread terror all over the
country—all the more as it was entirely unexpected,
and certainly might have been prevented. Báthory,
the palatine, and John Szapolyai stood, each with
a great army, not very far from Belgrade; but these
noblemen, obeying only the dictates of their mutual
hatred, would not join their armies, and truly
says the poet Charles Kisfaludy, that the deepest
wounds inflicted upon the poor country were “no,
not by her enemies, but by her own sons.” Louis
himself was roused from his lethargy upon hearing
the sad news. He upbraided his councillors for
neglecting to warn him of the dangers menacing the
country, and for not having taken measures to avert
them; nay, in his exasperation, as we are informed
by his chaplain, he struck one of his councillors,
Bishop Szalkay, in the face. Repentance was now
too late, and the impending catastrophe seemed unavoidable.
It is true that the Hungarians achieved
one more victory in the Hungarian Lowlands. Paul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
Tömöry, the newly appointed archiepiscopal captain-in-chief
of that section, defeated Ferhat Pasha on the
field of Nagy-Olasz, in Syrmia. But the passing
glow of this success left no permanent effects; three
years later the Turks were more formidable than
ever to Hungary.</p>

<p>While the Hungarian Diet was the scene of fierce
discussions, Francis I., King of the French, smarting
under the defeat he had suffered at the hands of the
Emperor Charles V., stirred up Solyman against
Hungary and the Hapsburg crown-lands, in order to
effect a division of the imperial army. In this
scheme Francis I. succeeded so well that in the
month of August, 1526, an army exceeding 300,000
men, with 300 cannon, under the lead of Solyman,
was invading Hungary.</p>

<p>The news of Solyman’s approach found the country
unprepared. The treasury did not contain money
enough to pay the messengers, still less to organize
an army. A requisition of the gold and silver plate
and vessels of the church was of little avail, for what
little could be collected, owing to the resistance of
the clergy, was appropriated again by the nobles,
who were charged with the duty of coining them
into money. Caspar Serédy owed his wealth to such
transactions.</p>

<p>In soldiers they were even poorer than in money.
The sultan was already crossing the southern frontier,
and not a soldier was near King Louis. The cities
bought their exemption from military service with
money, and the great nobles were dilatory. The
king finally marched alone against the enemy. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
guilty were seized with shame at this noble example,
and about the beginning of August four thousand
men had already rallied round him. He was steadily
proceeding southward and reached Mohács in the
latter part of August. The army had swelled by this
time to twenty-five thousand men, but it wanted a
commander, and there was not in the whole country
a single general capable of wielding large forces. The
king, under these circumstances, had no other choice
but to appoint, as commander-in-chief, Paul Tömöry,
whose victory achieved over the Turks was still fresh
in memory. Shortly afterwards the Turkish army,
which had occupied Peterwardein (Pétervárad) a few
days before, made its appearance. A serious discussion
arose now whether the Hungarians should stand
a battle, or, retreating first, join the army of Christopher
Frangepán, coming from Slavonia, and that
of John Szapolyai, marching from Transylvania.
Tömöry was in favor of accepting battle at once, and
was sustained by the king. Francis Perényi, the witty
bishop of Grosswardein, on seeing that Tömöry’s
counsels had prevailed, is reported to have said:
“The Hungarian nation will have twenty thousand
martyrs on the day of battle, and it would be well to
have them canonized by the pope.” The battle
took place on the 29th of August, on a fine summer’s
day. The Hungarians formed in battle array early
in the morning. The king, surrounded by his lay
and ecclesiastical magnates, occupied the centre. A
thousand mailed horsemen were around the king,
and in their midst John Drágfy, the Chief-Justice of
the land, waving high up in the air the national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
banner. Seated on a white horse, he wore no spurs,
according to the ancient custom, implying that flight
to him was impossible.</p>

<p>Báthory, afflicted with the gout, rode with the
king along the line of each troop, addressing words
of encouragement to the men. The whole army impatiently
looked forward to the moment when the
battle should begin, and, finally, at five o’clock in
the afternoon the Turks advanced. It was remarked
that the king, on the silver helmet being placed on
his head, became deathly pale, as if in anticipation
of the near danger, but while it shocked the attendants,
it by no means disheartened them.</p>

<p>The first onslaught came from the Hungarian
horse, who rushed upon the enemy in front of them
and drove them back. The Turkish troops thus attacked
retreated without offering any resistance to
the body of the army. The Hungarians, shouting
victory, pressed on in hot pursuit, little dreaming
that they were running into the jaws of sure destruction.
The retreat was but a feint, for when the
Hungarian army had been drawn on near enough to
the Turkish centre, the retreating troops opened
their ranks, and, through the gap left open, three
hundred cannon and several thousand Janissaries
poured a murderous fire on the advancing troops.
The slaughter was dreadful; a large portion of the
troops, including their commander and their standard
bearer, fell at the first fire. The rest fled in
every direction, but were greatly impeded in their
retreat by a violent shower of rain which suddenly
burst on the fugitives, among whom was also the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
youthful king. As he was trying to cross the Csele,
a small brook, swollen by the rain, the horse, after
reaching the opposite bank, stumbled backward into
the waters below, and buried his rider under him.</p>

<p>The prophecy of Perényi was fulfilled. Twenty
thousand martyrs strewed the field of Mohács, and
among them was the witty prophet himself. The
Hungarians paid the heavy penalty of thirty-six
years’ misrule and disorder, but the worst was yet to
come. On the 10th of September there passed
again a brilliant procession through the gates of
Buda. This time it was not the crowned king of
Hungary who made his entry into the fortress, but
Solyman, who delivered it up for pillage to his
soldiers. On this occasion was destroyed the famous
library of Matthias.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br /><br />

<small>THE TURKISH WORLD AND THE RISE OF PROTESTANTISM
IN HUNGARY.</small></h2>

<p>While Islam was rapidly losing ground, and hurrying
to irretrievable destruction on the peninsula
south of the Pyrenees, it obtained a fresh foothold
on another southern peninsula of Europe, in
the regions of the Balkan washed by the Mediterranean
Sea, and became there so powerful as to
influence, for nearly five centuries, the political
destinies of the Western world. At the same time
that the power and culture of the Moorish state was
declining in Spain, Europe found itself assailed by
another Mohammedan nation, the Turks, who, taking
up the standard of the crescent, attempted to
force upon the Christian world their new ideas,
religious, political, and social. On the first appearance
of the Turks on the Balkan peninsula, they were
met by the two states which opposed their further
advance, and the struggle with these began at once.
The first, the Byzantine empire, was, however, at this
time already an effete and tottering organization,
an ancient and venerable ruin, and it was able to
make but a feeble resistance. It retreated step by
step before the Asiatic conquerors, who got posses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>sion,
first, of its entire outlying territory, and finally
captured (in 1453) the seat of government, Byzantium,
the renowned city of Constantine. The second
opponent which withstood the advance of the
Turks was Hungary, a state which, though still
young, had shown a sturdy national vitality, and
successively reduced to vassalage the countries of
the Balkan, and was steadily engaged in extending
its influence and authority towards the East. The
Turks could not dispose of Hungary as easily and
quickly as of the enfeebled Byzantine empire.
More than a century of nearly constant conflict
had to elapse before the Hungarian supremacy in
the regions of the Balkan was put an end to, and
the Turks were able to penetrate as far as Mohács,
and there to inflict a mortal blow on the independence
of Hungary. During this struggle of a century
and a half the name and fame of Hungary were
perpetuated by many a brilliant feat of war, and by
many glorious victories, and when John Hunyadi,
the most formidable foe of the Turks, died, all
Europe mourned his death as the loss of the great
champion of Christianity. His son, Matthias the
Just, one of the greatest kings of Hungary, whose
memory is held in pious reverence by the Hungarian
people to this day, following in the footsteps
of his illustrious father, through his many triumphs,
made his own name, too, hardly less formidable
to the Turks. But Hungary, as the offspring of
the Western Church, the Church of Rome, turned
her looks, at that time, to the West rather than
to the East, and Hungarian statesmanship was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
far more intent upon humiliating the emperor of what
was then known as the Roman empire, than upon
breaking down the power of the Turks. King Matthias
captured Vienna, and made large conquests at
the expense of the German empire, but he chastised the
Turks only now and then, and never seriously thought
of endeavoring to thoroughly crush the Turkish
power. Under his feeble successors, the Turks, who
easily recuperated from the losses of single battles,
grew into a formidable power, which soon brought
Hungary to the verge of ruin. We have described, in
the preceding pages, the fatal battle of Mohács, fought
on the 29th of August, 1526, in which the youthful
King Louis II. opposed an army of hardly 25,000
men to Solyman’s 300,000, to be swept away by
the torrent of overwhelming numbers. To give an
adequate idea, however, of this awful catastrophe
in the annals of Hungary, we will add here that
seven bishops and archbishops, thirteen lords of the
banner, five hundred magnates, and many thousand
nobles laid down their lives on the bloody battle-field.</p>

<p>The nation was seized with indescribable terror
on learning the details of this dreadful calamity;
entire villages were deserted by their inhabitants,
who scattered in every direction. The widowed
queen, finding herself utterly deserted in Buda,
fled to Presburg, and the capital of Hungary, one of
the finest cities of Christendom, which but a little
more than a generation before had been made one of
the chief centres of European learning and culture,
passed, in less than two weeks after the fatal day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
Mohács, without any resistance, into the hands of the
victorious Solyman. The Turks sacked and set fire to
the beautiful city, and all its magnificent buildings,
save the royal palace, were destroyed by the flames.
The victorious enemy met with as little opposition in
ravaging and massacring in the country as they had
encountered at the capital. There was no one to
stay their devastations. The miserable peasantry
still made some feeble attempts at defence; here and
there a few thousand men collected at some fortified
position to protect themselves and their families.
Thus some 20,000 men retreated into the Vértes
mountains, and, under the leadership of Michael
Dobozy, entrenched themselves near the village of
Marót, in a camp fortified by a barricade constructed
of wagons. But the Turks had their guns carried up
to the nearest eminence, and opened a fire on the
occupants of the improvised wall. The peasants
were struck with terror, and the undisciplined boors,
the wailing women and children, deserted their sheltering
wagons in despair. Dobozy, seeing that all
was lost, mounted his gallant steed, and placing his
young wife on the saddle before him, he sought
safety in flight. The elated Turks fell upon the flying
Hungarians, frightfully massacring their ranks.
Among the fugitives, Dobozy especially attracted
the enemy’s attention, owing to the superiority
of his armor, indicative of gentle blood, and
more particularly because of the young woman he
carried in his arms. They pursued him like bloodhounds.
The distance between the pursuers and
pursued gradually diminished, and Dobozy’s horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
began to show signs of exhaustion under the double
burden. Wife and husband saw the fierce forms,
eager for prey, draw nearer and nearer. Still there
was a gleam of hope for them if they could reach the
near brook, cross the bridge, and destroy it before
their pursuers came up with them. They succeeded
in gaining the bridge, but, alas, the flying peasants
had already broken it off, and there was no other
thoroughfare to the opposite bank.</p>

<p>All was lost now. Dobozy told his wife to fly by
herself, whilst he would remain and stay with his
own breast the progress of their pursuers. But the
young spouse would not part from her loving husband,
not even in death, and besought him to kill
her rather than to expose her to the chance of falling
into the hands of the pagan enemy. The desperate
husband, seeing the Turks quite near to them,
stabbed his youthful wife with his own dagger, and
then, turning upon his adversaries, dearly sold his
life. The spot where Dobozy and his faithful wife
lost their lives is, to this day, called Basaharcz
(the Pasha struggle).</p>

<p>The immense Turkish army spread all over the
country, everywhere plundering, ravaging, and destroying
defenseless lives, and reducing, in a war of
a few months’ duration, the population of the country
by nearly 200,000 souls. The capital in ruins,
hundreds of other places deserted and laid waste,
the country without a king, the church without any
higher clergy, the greater part of the nobility, used
to arms, killed—such was the condition in which
Hungary was left by the Turks at the departure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
Sultan Solyman. In October, 1526, he left the
doomed country, having first laden his ships, sailing
for Constantinople, with the treasures of the palace
of King Matthias—its rare curiosities, its bronze
statues, and a portion of the famous Corvinian
library.</p>

<p>The fatal day of Mohács had entirely overturned
the order in the state, and amongst the magnates
who survived it party strife soon broke out. One
party, acting upon the conviction that enfeebled
Hungary was unable to resist, unsupported, the overwhelming
power of the Turks, elected a Hapsburg
archduke, Ferdinand of Austria, a brother of Charles
V., the Roman emperor, king of Hungary, and since
that time the royal crown has, in fact, remained in
possession of the Hapsburgs. It was through this
dynasty that the Hungarian people endeavored to
secure the aid of the German empire against the
Osmanlis. But another party amongst the great lords
pursued an opposite course. In their opinion a native
dynasty and peaceful relations with the invincible
Turks were the means of rescuing the country from
her pitiable plight. These patriots, therefore, elected
as king of Hungary, John Szapolyai, the vayvode of
Transylvania, and the most powerful lord in the country,
and thus the nation had now two kings in the
place of the one who had fallen at Mohács.</p>

<p>But neither of these parties nor their royal representatives
could save the country from the Turks;
on the contrary, the continual rivalries between the
two kings not only demoralized public virtue and
upset all law and authority within the kingdom, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
they assisted not a little the foreign enemy in getting
into their possession, by slow degrees, the larger part
of Hungary, and enabled the Turks, within a brief
period, to float their crescent on the towers of Buda,
and there, to the ruin of the nation, and to the perpetual
terror of the Christian world, it continued to
wave for nearly one hundred and fifty years. The
history of the Hungarian nation during this entire
period is sad in the extreme—a tragedy, the scenes
of which are supplied by an uninterrupted series of
trials and sufferings. Owing to the incapacity of the
leading statesmen and generals, the ruin of the country
became more and more irretrievable. Yet, however
dark and forlorn this period may seem, the national
sufferings of those days are relieved and brightened
by the glorious heroism and patriotism displayed
by the people. The Hungarians, although
menaced, in their very existence, by many enemies,
by party strife, and religious dissensions, exhibited
such rare moral courage, heroism, devotion, self-denial,
and manliness, that the memory of the generations
of that melancholy era will remain forever
hallowed. Heroes arose on every side, and the
struggle, sustained by the nation for nearly a century
and a half against the oppressive power of the
Turks, reminds one, in many of its features, of the
protracted contest between the Spaniards and the
Moors, and, like it, abounds in poetry, romance, and
those noble examples of patriotism and loftiness of
soul which kindle the human heart, arouse the sympathies
of the poet, and are treasured up by the
piety of after-ages as glorious relics of the past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>

<p>Solyman’s ambitious schemes looked for still wider
fields of conquest, and in 1529 he marched towards
Vienna, in order to attack King Ferdinand in his
own capital. The city, however, was successfully
defended. In 1532 Solyman advanced again upon
Vienna. The sultan’s progress was unopposed until
he reached Köszeg (German, Güns), in the neighborhood
of the Austrian frontier. The keys of sixteen
fortresses and fortified cities lay at his feet; Köszeg
alone refused to do homage, and arrested the sultan’s
triumphal march. Michael Juricsics was its commander;
he was just about to remove his small
garrison, consisting of twenty-eight hussars and
ten cuirassiers, to Vienna, for whose defence all
the available forces were being called in, when the
Turks appeared beneath the walls of Köszeg. On
beholding the approach of the immense Turkish
army, Juricsics took a bold and noble resolution.
He determined to hold the fortress, and to die rather
than surrender it to the enemy. He immediately
took measures to defend the place; he repaired the
walls and bastions, armed seven hundred peasants
who had sought refuge in the city, and purchased
with his own money gunpowder and provisions.
The Turkish army arrived under the walls of Köszeg
on the 5th of August, 1532; a few days later the
sultan himself joined them, and the siege was prosecuted
at once with the utmost energy. The outer
fortifications had already fallen into the hands of the
enemy, the guns and mines had effected a breach
sixteen yards wide in the main wall of the citadel, of
its seven hundred defenders half had fallen, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
the 24th of August Juricsics had but one hundred
weight of gunpowder left. Yet the plucky reply he
gave to the sultan’s summons to surrender was: “As
long as I live I will not surrender.” The Turks thereupon
directed a fresh assault upon the citadel, and
the garrison again lost many lives, while Juricsics
himself was wounded. The Turks pressed into the
city, but the inhabitants, at their approach, broke
out into such dreadful howling and wailing that the
frightened assailants retreated, and the city was
once more miraculously spared. But Juricsics himself
saw now the impossibility of further resistance;
he had no more gunpowder, and most of the garrison
were like himself wounded. For the purpose,
therefore, of sparing the lives of the remaining inhabitants,
he finally permitted the Turkish flag to be
hoisted over the city. Solyman, seeing the Turkish
flag floating over Köszeg, thought he had captured
the citadel, and retired from under the walls on the
31st of August. But it was not towards Vienna that
he directed his steps, but homeward. He had been
delayed nearly four weeks near Köszeg, and during
this time a powerful army had been collected in
Vienna which the sultan had not the courage to
face. Juricsics had thus, by his heroism, saved
Vienna from a siege, the issue of which might have
been calamitous to that renowned city of Christendom.</p>

<p>Many were still found in other parts of the country
to follow the stirring example set by Juricsics, but
unfortunately success but rarely attended their devotion.
Most of them were fated only to be martyrs to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
the sacred cause, shedding their blood on the altar
of their tottering country. The farther the Turkish
conquests extended the more precarious and perilous
became the position of the isolated commanders
of the Hungarian border fortresses. The safety of a
whole territory or country often depended upon the
possession of one of these strongholds. Thus were
the wealthy mining towns and the entire Hungarian
mining region protected by the fortified place of
Drégel, and it naturally attracted the attention of
the Turks, always thirsting for plunder, who hastened
to lay siege to it, hoping, by its possession, to
open the road to the mines. Gallant George Szondi,
the commandant of the fortress of Drégel, was a determined
and magnanimous man who, fully conscious
of the great importance of the place, was
ready to defend it with his life. The fortress itself
was not one of the first order, and was guarded only
by a small garrison.</p>

<p>In July, 1552, a Turkish army numbering about
10,000 appeared under the walls. Ali, the Pasha
of Buda, himself a chivalrous and noble-minded
soldier, stood at the head of the besiegers, and,
under the fire of his guns, the bastions crumbled to
dust in the course of a few days. When the great
tower too, was but a heap of ruins, and the walls
were showing wide gaps everywhere, and all hope
of being able to continue the defence seemed to
have vanished, Ali sent a message to the commandant
of Drégel. He employed a clergyman
by the name of Márton, the parish priest of a
neighboring village, to go to Szondi and to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
him that: “Ali reverently bowed before Szondi’s
bravery and determined spirit, the report of which
had reached him long ago, and of which he had
had good occasion to convince himself during the
present siege, but as the position could be held
no longer, Szondi ought to preserve his heroic
life and to surrender the crumbling fortress, and
if this were done free departure should be guaranteed
for himself and his people.” Szondi silently
listened to the message of Ali, whom he knew to
be a noble and chivalrous foe, but manfully declined
to lay down his arms. He was resolved to
defend the place to his last breath, and rather
bury himself under its ruins than negotiate with
the enemy. But he in turn asked now a favor of
Ali Pasha, not for himself, but for two youthful
troubadours, two young bards who were in the
fortress, and for whom the Hungarian hero wished
to provide before his death. He had the youths
dressed in purple velvet and sending them, under
the care of Father Márton, to Ali Pasha, he requested
the latter to take these youths—some say
they were his own sons—into his service, as he
himself would not be able to bring them up, and
to make brave men of them. Then summoning
into his presence two Turkish captives remaining
in the fortress, he bestowed upon them rich presents
and allowed them to depart.</p>

<p>As soon as Márton had left with his youthful
charges Szondi felt that the supreme moment, the
moment of a glorious death, was near at hand. He
ordered his money, his clothes, and all his valu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>ables
to be taken into the courtyard of the citadel,
and, for fear they might fall into the hands
of the enemy, he himself set fire to them and saw
them reduced to ashes. Then he directed his
steps to the stables, and thrust with his own
hands his lance through his horses, his noble war
steeds. Hastening now to his few remaining soldiers
he addressed to them touching words of
farewell. Outside, the approach of the Turks,
preparing for the assault and shouting Allah, was
already heard. Szondi, at the head of his two companies,
rushed to the citadel gate and there laid
down his life after heroically defending himself. A
ball having penetrated his foot, the dying man sank
on his knees and continued the fight to his last
breath. He was finally cut down by the Turks, who
surrounded him on all sides; his head was placed on
a lance and carried in triumph to the victorious Ali.
The generous Turk was deeply moved by this noble
example of self-sacrifice, and, having given orders to
seek out Szondi’s body, he caused his remains to be
buried with great military pomp, in a neighboring
hill. For a long time the spot where Szondi was
laid into the grave was marked by a pike and a flag.
One of the greatest poets of modern Hungary, John
Arany, has perpetuated Szondi’s story in a beautiful
ballad, and contemporary piety has just erected
amidst the ruins of Drégel a chapel in memory of
the departed hero.</p>

<p>Stephen Losonczy, another Hungarian hero, who
shared Szondi’s fate a few days later, had no such
noble opponent as Ali to deal with. Temesvár, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
largest fortress in the country, was entrusted to his
care. Fifty thousand Turks marched on Temesvár,
and having quickly reduced all the smaller fortified
places and cities near it, they reached the fortress
in an over-confident mood. Losonczy immediately
sallied out to meet the enemy, and so intimidated
them that they soon gave up the siege and left the
neighborhood. Yet only for a short time; they returned
in greater numbers under the leadership of
Ahmed Pasha. The latter at once called upon the
Hungarian commandant to surrender the fortress.
Losonczy collected in the public square the garrison
which numbered altogether 2,200 soldiers, of whom
1,300 were Hungarians and the remainder Germans,
Czechs, and Spaniards, and asked them if they were
ready to defend to death the fortress in their charge.
The enthusiastic shouts of the soldiers—that they
were ready to die rather than yield up the place—was
the answer he received. Losonczy at once
swore in his men, and immediately answered the
summons of the Turkish pasha by a sally from the
fortress, driving the enemy from the vicinity of the
trenches.</p>

<p>The Turks now proceeded to lay regular siege to
the fortress—a branch of military science in which
they were highly accomplished. They were masters
in the art of reducing fortified places, in the mining
works, and in the handling of the great battering guns.
Thirty-six guns of heavy calibre soon poured their
shots into the fortifications, which after a couple of
days exhibited such breaches that the pasha thought
the time for an assault had arrived. Thousands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
brave Janissaries rushed at the tottering walls. There,
however, they were met by the guard, who, themselves
ready to die, made a frightful havoc amongst their
assailants. The assault was repulsed in a few hours,
the trenches were filled with the Turkish dead, and
many a distinguished bey and officer of high rank
was left lifeless on the scene of the sanguinary contest.</p>

<p>Losonczy, however, saw that all the heroism of his
soldiers was thrown away if he did not receive aid
from abroad. He therefore applied to the commanders
of the royal and Transylvanian armies for
soldiers, gunpowder, and other war requisites of which
he had run short, but could obtain nothing from them.
In this strait he resolved to devote his own fortune to
the cause of his country, and wrote to his wife, the
high-minded Anna Pekry, who was outside the fortress,
to turn all he had into money, to mortgage his
estates, and, with the funds thus obtained, to hire
soldiers, purchase munitions, and send them into the
besieged fortress. The generous woman was ready
to bring any sacrifice to assist her husband in his extreme
distress, and, taking into her pay five hundred
volunteers (hayduks) whom she provided with the
necessary military equipments, she bade them march
to the relief of Temesvár. But the place was already
completely invested, and the small troop was unable
to penetrate the strong blockading cordon of the
Turks. The five hundred hayduks were dispersed
by the enemy, the gunpowder was taken away from
them, and now Losonczy gave up all hope of aid from
without.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the gallant commander never for a moment
wavered in his duty. He wrote, in one of his last
letters: “We are patiently looking forward to the
moment when we must die,” and all he asked of the
king was to take care of his little orphans. The hour
was not far off, for the long siege had already exhausted
their ammunition and provisions, and the
Turks were constantly renewing their assaults. Although
the enemy lost at times three thousand men
in one assault, they returned each day in still greater
numbers and repeated the attack. St. Anne’s Day
arrived, the day of the patron saint of Anna,
Losonczy’s wife, which in brighter days he used to
celebrate, according to ancestral fashion, by merry
carousing, but it was now a melancholy day for the
brave commander. The provisions and ammunition
were all exhausted, and the Turks, after immense
losses, had finally succeeded in occupying the large
entrenched tower lying between the inner citadel
and the town.</p>

<p>Hungry, without gunpowder, and with no hope of
relief from abroad, Losonczy’s soldiers began at last
to mutiny, and, wishing to save their lives, they insisted
upon the surrender of the town. The Spanish
soldiers—the foreigners—especially demanded
the giving up of the place, while the Hungarians
declared that they were still ready to follow their
gallant leader to death. The inhabitants of the town,
reflecting that by a capitulation they might save
their lives and property, whereas if the Turks entered
the city by force of arms they would be shown no
mercy, finally sided with the Spanish party and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
bent upon making terms with the enemy. At first
Losonczy would not hear of yielding, but when
Ahmed Pasha’s messengers appeared at the fortress
and promised every one safe departure, besides the
right of taking with him all his movables, the Spaniards
compelled him to sign the capitulation.</p>

<p>So the brave soldier at last gave up the struggle,
and, troubled by sad forebodings, he withdrew from
the ruined fortress at the head of his decimated
troops, who were still fully armed. Outside the
gate he was received with military honors by the
Turkish commanders. Losonczy was proceeding on
his good horse through the ranks of the enemy which
were in a line drawn up on either side, when suddenly
there came from the Hungarians in the rear
shoutings and cries. He turned back and saw that
the Turks, in shameful disregard of the terms of
capitulation, had fallen upon his pages and were pillaging
them. The old warrior could not witness this
disgrace unmoved; he drew his sword, once more
the war-trumpet sounded the attack, and he rushed
to the rescue of his men. The engagement became
general and the small band was almost entirely cut
down. Losonczy fearlessly braved death, and, bleeding
from numerous wounds, was finally taken by the
perfidious enemy, who, cutting off the hero’s head,
sent it as a token of triumph to Stambul. Thus, in
1552, passed Temesvár, one of the most important
fortified places in Hungary, into the possession of the
Turks. It remained longer under the Turkish yoke
than any other Hungarian stronghold of importance,
for thirty years elapsed after the reconquest of Buda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
before it was again restored to the possession of the
king of Hungary.</p>

<p>Szondi and Losonczy might have been spared
martyrdom if the commander-in-chief of the royal
army, who were all foreigners, had, in their vanity,
had the courage to attempt their rescue. They witnessed,
sunk in cowardly inactivity, the deadly throes
of these heroes, and looked on with indifference
while one fort after the other was falling into hostile
hands. These foreign commanders, with their armies
composed of foreigners, were never able to cope with
the Turks. If they ventured to engage in a battle
they were sure to lose it. In this way can it be
accounted for that in spite of the superhuman efforts
of the Hungarians who heroically battled for their
country, the Turkish conquests grew apace, and the
flat portions of the land, the rich and fertile lowlands,
passed under the rule of the Osmanlis. Transylvania,
the eastern portion of the country, had struggled
into a sort of independence, and severing herself
gradually from the mother-country, had a separate
state organization of her own under her native rulers,
so that Hungary may be said at this time to have
been cut up into three parts. The largest portion
accepted the Turkish supremacy, Transylvania asserted
its independence, and the remaining and
smallest division acknowledged the kings of the
Hapsburg dynasty, whose residence was in Vienna.
The German, Italian, and Spanish troops employed
by the latter, together with those by whom they
were led, so far from being instrumental in the liberation
of the country, indulged in the same licen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>tious
and lawless behavior as the Turks themselves.
They were utterly ignorant of the language, customs,
and institutions of the Hungarian people, and were
entirely indifferent to the interests of the country.
These irresponsible military bodies harassed and
plundered the native population to such an extent
that it was not long before the Hungarians came to
hate the foreign soldiery, and the Germans in general,
as much as they did the Turks.</p>

<p>But even during the most depressing days, and
under circumstances of a most desperate and hopeless
character, the spirit of heroism did not die out
amongst the Hungarian people. Shortly after the
reduction of Temesvár the immense Turkish army
marched against Erlau. Stephen Dobó was the commandant
of the latter place. He knew by the sad
examples of Losonczy and Szondi what was in store
for him, and, although the royal troops were near,
he also knew, from experience, that he could not depend
upon any help from that quarter, and must
needs look to his own resources to stay the progress
of the overwhelming forces of the Osmanlis. “We
expect aid from God only, and not from men,” he
wrote at the approach of the enemy. He immediately
took measures to defend the place; he laid in
large supplies of ammunition, sulphur, saltpetre, and
provisions, sent his lieutenant, Mecsey, a soldier
worthy of his chief, into the adjoining counties to
fire the hearts of the young men, and to invite them
to enroll themselves amongst the defenders of the
fortress. He made up his garrison of Hungarians
only, knowing, from experience, that the foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
hirelings could not be trusted. He had altogether
only nine guns and nine gunners, but he hurriedly
drilled the students and the more intelligent amongst
the peasants in artillery practice, and formed them
into a separate corps of cannoniers. Having provided
every thing in time, and placing his trust in
God and his own strength, he calmly awaited the
enemy.</p>

<p>No sooner had the immense Turkish army arrived,
when Ahmed Pasha summoned Dobó to surrender
the fortress. Dobó collected about him his men and
publicly read to them the pasha’s letter. The gallant
Hungarian garrison shouted, as with one heart,
that they would never surrender the place. Dobó,
his fellow-officers, and all the men, then took a solemn
oath to fight to the bitter end, and that, if any
one but breathed about the surrender, he should be
hanged on the pillar of the town well. As an answer
to Ahmed’s missive, Dobó caused to be placed upon
one of the lofty towers of the bastion a large iron
coffin with two lances, one of them floating the
Hungarian flag, and the other the Turkish. This
was to convey to the enemy that on this place either
the Turks or the Hungarians must perish, and in
order to give weight to his answer he sallied forth
with part of his garrison that very night, and brought
away from the besiegers a great deal of booty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="i330" id="i330">
<img src="images/i_330.png" width="500" height="322" alt="HEROIC DEFENCE OF ERLAU." />
<span class="caption">HEROIC DEFENCE OF ERLAU.</span></a></div>

<p>Ahmed retorted by opening a fire on the town and
citadel from 120 guns, some of which sped balls of
fifty pounds as far as the bastion, but eighteen days
elapsed before the enemy could summon up sufficient
courage to try an assault. It proved ineffec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a><br /><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>tual,
the assailants being gallantly repulsed by the
Hungarians. A few days later a great calamity befell
the denizens of the citadel. The powder magazine,
struck by a hostile ball, exploded, and a portion of
the wall of the citadel was thrown down by the explosion.
Taking advantage of the wild confusion
the explosion had created amongst the garrison, the
enemy directed another assault against their works,
but quite as ineffectually as before. They were
driven back; Dobó had the wall repaired, and in the
cellar vaults he established a gunpowder factory,
which proved sufficient to furnish the necessary
supply.</p>

<p>After several unsuccessful minor attacks, the
Turks prepared for the great final assault. They
came against the fortress in overwhelming numbers
on every side, and already the garrison began
to show symptoms of exhaustion and wavering.
At that moment of supreme danger, however,
the gallant defenders of the citadel obtained help
from quite an unlooked-for quarter. Wives, mothers,
and daughters armed themselves, and rushed to
the walls to fight by the side of their dear ones.
Some of these amazons robbed the dead of their
swords, and rushed, thus armed, where the enemy
was thickest; others brought boiling water and oil,
and poured it upon the heads of those who attempted
to scale the walls; and, with the help of
these brave women, the assault was beaten back at
the most dangerous points. The women of Erlau
had a large share in the saving of the city, and the
fame of their heroic devotion still survives in Hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>gary.
The Turks were quite panic-struck; in one
day alone they lost 8,000 men: and the soldiers
loudly declared that God was fighting on the side of
the Hungarians, and who could struggle against
God? After a siege of thirty-eight days, the Turkish
army at length withdrew, and Dobó and his
brave men were left in possession of the now ruinous
citadel, thus preserving it for their country.
The glory of their daring deeds has passed into a
common saying. Of any one accomplishing a
great deed, the people say: “He has won the
fame of Erlau.” The place, nevertheless, passed
under Turkish rule in 1596, its Hungarian commandant
having been compelled by the foreign
garrison to capitulate.</p>

<p>In 1566 Sultan Solyman, who, though old, was still
full of vigor, placed himself at the head of a formidable
army, and invaded Hungary for the sixth
time, his object being to take Erlau and, eventually,
to march against Vienna. On reaching, with his
200,000 men and 300 guns, Hungarian territory, he
was met by the news that Mohammed Pasha, his
favorite, together with his army, had been massacred
by the Hungarians at Szigetvár. The aged sultan
desired to avenge this affront at once. Szigetvár
and its brave commander, Nicholas Zrinyi, had long
since been troublesome to the Turks. Zrinyi, the
scion of a most ancient family, had been engaged
for years in constant fighting against the Moslem
power, during those periods even when peace was
officially established. His possessions and castles
lay in the border territory, and the fearless man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
was ever at war with the Osmanlis, making them
feel the weight of his irresistible sword. The
storming of Szigetvár had been attempted once
before, but the enemy had been beaten back with
great slaughter. And now the great sultan determined
himself to bring him to terms, and to
invest in person the small fortress. Zrinyi was
prepared for the worst, and calmly got ready to
face the formidable foe. Szigetvár was not a fortress
of the first rank, but only one of the minor
strong places. The main feature of its strength
was that it lay almost entirely surrounded by lake
and marsh, the only road leading to the place
being over the bridge communicating with the
gate. In front of the citadel, on an island, was
the old town, and south of it, on another island,
the so-called new town. Szigetvár, therefore, consisted,
in point of fact, of three places, each fortified,
but differing from each other in the strength
of their works of defence. The two towns were,
in reality, advanced fortifications of the fortress
itself. Without much aid from any quarter, Zrinyi
undertook the defence of this small place. His
own money purchased the necessary ammunition
and military supplies; he filled the granaries with
provisions, produced on his own estates, and from
his cellar came the necessary wine. There was an
abundance of provisions in the place, but there
were not soldiers enough. When it became quite
certain that the sultan was marching his whole
army against Szigetvár, all Zrinyi could obtain
from the king, after repeatedly urging his want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
of soldiers, was the permission to hire one thousand
foot-soldiers. German soldiers, it is true,
were offered to him, but those he did not want,
preferring to select his troops from amongst the
garrisons of his own castles, so as to have only
tried men by his side. All the force he could muster
to oppose to the hundreds of thousands of
Solyman numbered, at the highest, 2,500 men. He
had 54 guns and 800 hundredweights of gunpowder,
and, what was worth more than all that, he and his
men were inspired by the sublime resolve, rather to
die on the field of honor than to submit to the cruel
enemy, who had turned into a desert a large portion
of their beautiful country. His soldiers worshipped
their heroic leader, and enthusiastically
pledged their devotion by oaths of fidelity and
obedience.</p>

<p>On the 31st of July, 1566, the advance guard of
the enemy showed itself. During the first few days
several minor engagements took place, but the
siege began in real earnest on the 7th of August. On
that day the first assault was attempted; it was directed
against the weakest point, the new town,
but it met with no success. A few days later, however,
Zrinyi himself deemed it expedient to give up
the defence of this advanced position, and, after having
set fire to the new town and reduced it to ashes,
he abandoned it to the enemy. The besiegers immediately
occupied it and erected their batteries,
protected by bags and baskets filled with earth, and
sacks of wool. The batteries were hardly ready
when the Hungarians surprised them one night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
and destroyed them all. Chance, however, now favored
the Turks. A drought had prevailed during
two months, and the terrain surrounding the old
town had become so dry, as considerably to facilitate
the approach of the enemy. The besiegers attempted
also to drain the lake surrounding the fortress, and
planned to accomplish this by cutting through the
great dam around it, so as to provide an outlet for
the waters. The neighborhood of the dam became
the scene of fierce struggles. The position was
heroically defended by the Hungarians, while the
Turks quite as heroically again and again returned to
the attack. After a sanguinary contest lasting the
whole day, the Turks finally took the old town on
the 19th of August, and Zrinyi with his shrunken
garrison entirely withdrew to the citadel, after having
demolished the bridge leading to the old town.</p>

<p>Sultan Solyman, however, now thought that lives
enough had been lost, and he therefore tried to get
possession of the fortress by peaceable means. He
tried Zrinyi with fair promises; he sent him messages
that he would make him prince of Dalmatia, Croatia,
and Slavonia, and tempted him with treasures
and estates. Then he tried him with threats. The
enemy had captured one of the trumpeters of Zrinyi’s
son, George. The trumpet found in the prisoner’s
possession had the arms of the Zrinyi family
painted on it, and Solyman sent this trumpet to
Szigetvár as a token that Zrinyi’s son had been
taken captive, and threatened that the prisoner
would be cruelly executed unless the place was surrendered.
Neither promises nor threats were of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
avail. Zrinyi did not for a moment waver, but was
steadfast in his determination to follow the dictates
of duty and patriotism alone.</p>

<p>The wrath of Solyman at the wearisomeness of
the siege knew no bounds. He had been patiently
expecting day after day the reduction of the place,
and finally, tired of further delay, gave the order for
a general assault on the 29th of August. The superstitious
sultan thought this a particularly lucky day,
for it was the anniversary of the day on which he
had taken Belgrade and of the battle at Mohács.
The aged ruler, who now, but rarely showed himself
to his soldiers, mounted his favorite charger and appeared
amongst the Janissaries, in order to rouse and
encourage them. His troops rushed enthusiastically
into the fight, for which the artillery and the engineers
conducting the siege had made every preparation
many days before. But Zrinyi was ready and
wide-awake, and drove the assailants back with great
slaughter. Aliportug, a Portuguese renegade, who
was the enemy’s most distinguished artillery officer
and military engineer, and had conducted the siege
of Sziget, lost his life during this engagement. The
Hungarians, although they too had suffered severe
losses, celebrated their triumph with bonfires and
feasting. They now fondly hoped that their heroic
resistance would at last induce the royal troops to
come to the relief of Sziget, and to attack the exhausted
troops of the sultan. Some negotiations to
that effect had been carried on, but the result was as
usual; the German commanders allowed the scanty
garrison to perish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span></p>

<p>The besiegers, after their last repulse, passed an
entire week without renewing the attack. They
employed this pause to lay unobserved a powerful
mine under the walls of the bastion, which was fired
by them on the 5th of September. The explosion
shattered the walls, the bastion fell down, and a terrible
gale carried the flames into the citadel in every
direction. All the buildings were soon on fire, and
the Turks too began a general assault. Hemmed in
by the dreadful conflagration and the storming enemy,
the Hungarians finally yielded. They retired
from the outer fortification, and Zrinyi with his
men—who had dwindled down to a few hundred—withdrew
into the inner or smaller fort. Further resistance
seemed now hopeless, yet Zrinyi did not
think of capitulating. The cannon-balls of the enemy
set on fire the smaller fort on the 7th of September.
Zrinyi, in this extremity, had all his valuables,
his thousands of gold and silver, his precious vessels
and plate, brought into the public square of the citadel
and cast into the flames. He then divested himself
of his armor and helmet, donned a dolmány (a
short jacket braided in front), and threw over it a
dark-blue velvet cloak, placing in each of his pockets
a hundred ducats as a reward to the man who should
discover his dead body. He wound a costly chain
of gold around his neck, in place of his helmet he
put on his head a kalpag (a Hungarian fur cap), ornamented
with a heron’s feather and diamond rosettes,
and, arming himself with a curved sabre and a light
shield, he took with him the keys of the citadel, to
make sure that they should pass into the enemy’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
hands only upon his death. In this attire he appeared
before his men, who were assembled in the
courtyard. He addressed them in a speech full of
his generous spirit, “lauding them for their gallant
conduct, which would earn for them the respect of
the Christian world and of generations to come.
The conclusion of their heroic career,” he added,
“ought to be worthy of their brilliant feats of the
past. There is but one road before us,” he continued,
“that of honor; all the other courses are
those of shame. You must either meet with death
here amid the flames, or must sally forth, and, dearly
selling your lives, die the deaths of heroes. Choose
between the two.” The kindling words of their
leader did not fail of their effect. At this supreme
moment the people of Szigetvár, in their exalted enthusiasm,
thought only of their honor. The very
women wished to follow the men on this their last
journey. Zrinyi had the bridge lowered and was the
first to advance upon it. Lawrence Juranics was at
his side carrying the large banner, and the other officers
promptly followed. About six hundred people
joined the sally of their heroic leader, who, after a
fierce struggle, laid down his devoted life. Of his
companions-in-arms but few escaped.<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">*</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_2" id="Footnote_A_2"></a><a href="#frontis"><span class="label">*</span>See Frontispiece.</a></p></div>

<p>Thus, after a glorious resistance of over six weeks,
did Szigetvár fall into the hands of the Turks. Sultan
Solyman did not see the victorious end of the siege;
he had expired a few days before in his camp. The
Turkish army returned home, and thus through
Zrinyi’s noble self-sacrifice was the entire campaign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>of the enemy rendered barren of results. The formidable
army which had menaced the whole country
wasted its strength at Szigetvár, and the capture of
this fortress alone cost the enemy 30,000 lives. Zrinyi’s
heroic death roused the admiration and sympathy of
the whole European world, and his name became
famous as one of the martyrs of Christianity.</p>

<p>Nor were the muses silent, in the midst of the
heroic combats which marked this sad period.
With so many inspiring themes presenting themselves,
the poet, the successor of the mediæval troubadour,
soon appeared on the scene to perpetuate
in song the memory of the glorious deeds. Among
others was Sebastian Tinódy, who described in verse
some of the most glorious of the episodes in the sad
chronicle of the sixteenth century. He visited the
scenes of the battles and engagements, sought out
the survivors or those who had taken a conspicuous
part, the captains and their brave followers, collecting
the incidents presented in his ballads. Tinódy
did not confine himself, however, to his lyre, but
was also an adept in the use of arms, and often took
part in the contests of his time, and had more than
once been wounded. Another and even more interesting
figure was that of Valentine Balassa, who
was as gallant a soldier as he was eminent as a poet.
His works, consisting in part of religious poems and
partly of lyric songs, have been, for three centuries,
the favorite reading of the Hungarian people. Some
of his writings have, however, come down to us in
manuscript only, and present a most valuable example
of the poetic genius of the Hungarians of his time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
Balassa lived a stirring, eventful and dangerous life,
which came to a glorious end on the field of honor.
At the storming of Gran, in 1597, he was among the
Hungarian besiegers, and the gallant poet received
a wound during the engagement, which soon proved
fatal.</p>

<p>In the midst of these perpetual struggles and successive
calamities closed the sixteenth century, and
began the seventeenth quite as inauspiciously for the
Hungarians. Until now they had cherished the
hope that the Hapsburg kings would rescue them
from the cruel rule of the Osmanlis. But after a
lapse of seventy years they not only saw their hopes
of liberation from the hated yoke destroyed, but had
the mortification of witnessing the continual spread
of the Turkish power. Besides, a sharp antagonism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
of another kind gradually arose between the nation
and their king. The national spirit, in spite of the
sad condition of the people, asserted itself more and
more, and frequently came into collision with the
foreign royal dynasty, whose seat of government was
without the frontiers of the country. This antagonism
was not only of a national, but also of a religious
character, for, while the largest part of Hungary was
overwhelmingly Protestant, the kings of this period
were among the staunchest supporters of the Church
of Rome. In addition to this, the kings, who were
at the same time emperors of Germany, had brought
themselves, by their autocratic actions, into direct
opposition to the constitution of the country and to
the rights and privileges guaranteed by law. As a
consequence a fierce constitutional contest was
raging, during the whole of the seventeenth century,
between the nation and their kings, which quite
overshadowed the struggle against the Turks. In
these contests the Hungarian people leaned for
support chiefly on the principality of Transylvania,
whose rulers, Stephen Bocskay, Gabriel Bethlen,
George Rákóczy I., not only made their comparatively
small country the bulwark of Hungarian nationality
and of the Protestant Church, but raised her to a position
of exceptional influence in European politics.</p>

<p>Before continuing to sketch the period of the
Turkish rule in Hungary, we will take a rapid glance
at the rise of Protestantism amongst the Hungarians.</p>

<span class="caption">HUNGARIAN PEASANTS IN AN INN.</span></a></div>

<p>The fall of Luther’s hammer upon the door of the
castle-church of Wittenberg, as he nailed to it his
famous theses, reverberated even in Hungary, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a><br /><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>produced an intense commotion in that distant country.
The period of the <i>renaissance</i>, the revival of art
and literature, had prepared all active and inquiring
minds for changes in church and religion. The country
had maintained an active intercourse, political,
commercial, and cultural, with the western nations,
and when Luther began the great work in Germany,
which was to mark a new era in the history of the
world, his ideas spread like wildfire all over Hungary,
and, especially, found favor amongst the German inhabitants,
who formed at that time an important
element of her population. The cities of Buda,
Oedenburg (Soprony), Presburg, the wealthy mining
regions in the north, the Királyföld in Transylvania,
were settled by Germans. Many of their clergy, attracted
by ties of national kinship had finished their
studies in Germany, and their merchants were closely
connected in business with those of the old fatherland.
Owing to the intimate relations thus established
between the Germans of Hungary and their brethren
abroad, the teachings of Luther gained almost as
rapidly ground among them as among their countrymen
in Germany, where the new doctrines had first
been promulgated. In the course of a few years the
new movement had assumed such formidable proportions
that it attracted the attention of the whole
nation.</p>

<p>The Catholic clergy, threatened in their supremacy,
were the first to take the field in defence of the
Church thus assailed. Round them very soon rallied
that class of the nation which, alone, enjoyed political
rights in the land, the entire nobility. In siding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
with the Catholic clergy, in this conflict against the
Reformation and its followers, the Lutherans, the
nobility were by no means actuated by religious motives
only. Their hostile attitude was rather owing
to important political considerations. The throne
was then occupied by Louis II., who was of Polish
extraction, the same youthful king who, noted
for his frivolous character, expiated the errors of
his reign upon the battle-field of Mohács. This unfortunate
ruler was personally as indifferent to religion
as to every thing else involving a serious turn of
mind. But his wife, Queen Mary, the sister of the
German emperor, Charles V., was all the more enthusiastic
in the defence of Luther’s teachings. The
queen and her German courtiers, by exerting a baneful
influence over the affairs of Hungary, had incurred
the ill-will of the nobility, which was identical with
the national party. This party, with a view to striking
a blow at the German and Lutheran sympathizers
surrounding the king, enacted from the outset
most rigorous laws against the Lutherans. Thus, as
early as 1523, a law was promulgated declaring Lutherans
and their protectors (clearly indicating by the
latter term the German courtiers of the king) foes to
the Holy Virgin Mary, the patroness of Hungary, and
as such, punishable with death and confiscation of
their property. The persecutions against the adherents
of the new faith began immediately. Luther’s
works and writings, which had been largely imported
into Hungary, were seized and consigned to the
flames. The Reformation, nevertheless, steadily
gained ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span></p>

<p>In the diets which, owing to the attacks threatening
the country from abroad and troubles at home,
were then held three or four times annually, the
national party, headed by John Szapolyai, one of
the most powerful lords of the land, was constantly
urging the cause of the Catholic Church. But there
were other political reasons, besides their antipathy
to the German courtiers, which determined the
national party to persist in their antagonism to the
new faith. The Osmanlis were continually harassing
the southern frontiers, and the country was always
on the brink of a war with them. The nobility,
representing the nation, felt instinctively that a
catastrophe was near at hand, which Hungary, by
her unaided strength alone, would be unable to avert.
They had to look for foreign aid, and effective help
from abroad could be expected only from the two
most powerful rulers in Christendom, the pope and
the emperor of Germany, both of whom were Luther’s
most determined opponents. They succeeded in
securing the good-will of the pope, who, having no
armies at his disposal to aid Hungary, assisted the
country by abundant supplies of money. In return
the nobility deemed it their sacred duty to keep a
faithful watch and ward over the interests of the
Catholic Church, and, in order to do so effectively,
they inaugurated relentless measures against the
Lutheran heretics. In 1525 another law was passed
against the votaries of the new creed, ordering their
extermination throughout the country, and declaring
that Lutherans, wherever they were found, should
suffer death by fire. This cruel law began its abom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>inable
work, and the funeral stakes soon sent forth
their lurid flames. The religious persecutions thus
inaugurated hastened the downfall of the Hungarian
kingdom.</p>

<p>The dreadful catastrophe at Mohács, in 1526, forced
Hungary into untrodden roads, not only politically,
but also in the matter of religion. The death of
her king, and the slaughter of so many prelates and
of thousands of nobles, on the fated battle-field,
gave a violent shock to the organization of both
state and church, and rendered easy the further extension
of the Reformation. Many of the great lords
and nobles, who hitherto had been the most ardent
supporters of the Catholic Church, speedily became,
from political motives or private interest, zealous
apostles of the new faith, so that the doctrines of
Luther, before principally confined to the inhabitants
of the cities, now found many adherents among the
magnates. The bondmen, too, who, even in matters
of religion, were compelled to obey the behests of
their masters, embraced the religion of their lords.
As a consequence, the victory of the Reformation became,
a few decades only after the battle of Mohács,
complete through the larger part of Hungary. The
doctrines of Luther had paved the way for the teachings
of Calvin. The latter, owing to their puritanic
spirit and democratic tendencies, which suited the
rooted predilection of the Magyar race for self-government,
spread mostly over the Hungarian section
of the country. The religion of Calvin, or the Helvetic
confession, had such a hold upon the Hungarian-speaking
population that it was soon desig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>nated
by the special name of the Hungarian faith,
while the Lutheran tenets were held chiefly by
the German denizens of the cities and the Slavic
inhabitants of the upper country. The ancient
Roman Church was confined to a comparatively small
territory, and during the seventeenth century hardly
numbered one seventh of the population.</p>

<p>One of the most shining pages in the law records of
Hungary—an enactment granting to the two Protestant
churches equal rights with the Catholic Church—is
connected with the name of Stephen Bocskay.
Although the Catholic Church had, during the sixteenth
century, lost most of its followers, yet legally,
and owing to the circumstance that the Hapsburg
kings were the most zealous propagators of the
Roman faith, it continued to be the only recognized
church, and to exercise an unduly preponderating influence
in public life, which, at that time, bore an
exclusively religious impress. The Hungarian magnates
and noblemen, then almost all Protestants,
under the leadership of Prince Stephen Bocskay,
took up arms against this privileged position of the
Catholic Church, as well as in defence of the laws of
the land, and succeeded in obtaining, in 1606, at the
peace of Vienna, a law whereby perfect equality between
the Protestant churches and the Catholic
Church was established. This great victory, achieved
by the Protestants, had the effect of rousing the
Catholic Church to energetic action. The anti-reformation
movement began in Hungary, as it had
already all over Europe, and produced, under the
direction of Cardinal Peter Pázmány, the archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
of Gran, in a comparatively short time, the most
surprising results. In the course of a few decades,
the most influential and leading families of the aristocracy
returned to the fold of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>The mass of the people, however, the nobility, the
inhabitants of the cities, and the peasantry, still remained
Protestants, and when the Transylvanian
princes, Gabriel Bethlen and George Rákóczy I., were
about to engage in war against the Hapsburgs, they
readily rallied around these bearers of the standard
of the national faith. The peace of Linz, a confirmation
of the treaty of Vienna, was concluded under
Rákóczy, again solemnly proclaiming the perfect
equality of the Protestant churches with the
Roman Catholic Church, an equality, however, which,
in point of fact, was never put into practice. The
written law and their good right was of no use to
the Protestants, for the power was gradually slipping
from their hands. Under the patronage of the royal
court, the anti-reformation movement had made great
conquests amongst the lower classes of the people,
and sometimes by the use of violence, sometimes by
other means, whole districts and large territories
again became Catholic. Elated by these successes,
the court of Vienna for a long time ignored its
promise of freeing the Hungarian people from the
Turkish yoke, and about sixty years elapsed without
any hostilities against the sultans. The chief
endeavor of the court was forcibly to deprive the
Hungarian nation of her constitutional institutions
which were based upon her nationality, and to subject
to imperial absolutism the people, jealous of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
their liberties and accustomed to freedom. These
unconstitutional proceedings on the part of the government
produced popular risings and party strife,
and were, in their sad consequences, fatal to thousands
of fanatics, spreading misery and poverty even
to those parts of the land which, from their geographical
positions, had been exempt from the
ravages of the Turks.</p>

<p>The cessation of hostilities did not interrupt the
continued ravages and devastations. Officially, it is
true, there was, for about sixty years, peace between
the royal court and the sultans, but this did not prevent
the latter from constantly indulging in minor
military operations. In 1663, however, when Leopold
I., who was of an eminently peaceful disposition,
held the throne, the Turks officially declared war.
Although it had already then become apparent that
the Turkish empire was impaired in strength, and,
more particularly, that her military organization had
degenerated, yet the Turks were eager for new battles,
and war was determined upon in Constantinople.
Hostilities soon commenced, and at St.
Gotthard, in 1664, the Turks got their first repulse,
for Christian arms there dealt them a heavy blow.
Not once during the two centuries that had gone by
were the Turks so overwhelmingly defeated on the
continent as on this occasion. Enslaved Hungary
breathed more freely, and already thought that the
long-hoped-for hour of shaking off Moslem thraldom
had arrived. But she was doomed to disappointment.
The brilliant triumph was not turned to
Hungary’s advantage in Vienna. A hasty peace was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
concluded with the terrified Turks, and thus was
prolonged for many decades the Turkish rule, which,
though enfeebled, was still ruinous to Hungary.</p>

<p>It was at this period, too, that a man of great
genius, and a true patriot, preached, with genuine
apostolic zeal, a crusade against the Turks. His
name was Nicholas Zrinyi. The namesake and great-grandson
of the hero of Szigetvár, he was himself a
gallant soldier and famous poet, and has immortalized,
in a grand Hungarian epic, the martyrdom of
his heroic ancestor. By his writings he fired the
hearts of his countrymen, and his life was passed on
bloody fields, in perpetual warfare against the Turks.
From his youth he had been inspired by one thought
only, to live and die for his country, and, although
a devout Catholic, he nobly proclaimed religious toleration,
at a time when the country was torn by religious
dissensions. His educated mind led him to
cultivate poetry, and to study the works of classical
authors on history and philosophy, but his chief interest
always remained the battle-field and the struggle
against the Turks. On one of his estates he had
a small fortress erected, called Zerinvár, from which
the Hungarians were in the habit of sallying forth
into the neighboring Turkish territory. This little
place was a thorn in the side of the Turk, and the
main cause of the declaration of war of 1663. Zrinyi,
however, defended it gallantly, and beat back the
assault of the enemy. In the course of the war he
took several Turkish fortresses, and burned down
and destroyed the bridge across the Drave, 4,000
paces in length, near Eszék, which had been built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
under Solyman, and which, being the main road
leading into the western part of the country, was defended
by trenches and other fortifications. The
repute made by Zrinyi’s extraordinary feats of war
resounded in all Europe, and he was loaded down
with distinctions by the pope, Louis XIV. of France,
and by the princes of Germany and Italy, as the
hero of Christendom. In the zenith of his glory, he
lost his life by a cruel accident. While engaged in
the chase, a wild boar rushed upon him, and wounded
him mortally. He was found by his servants, lying
on the ground, bathed in his own blood, and expired
shortly afterward. All Hungary and Christian
Europe lamented the loss of the distinguished soldier
and poet.</p>

<p>His devout wish, to see the Hungarian nation
freed from the oppressive rule of the Turks, did not
approach its fulfilment until twenty years after his
death. But even then it was not the royal court
which accomplished the work of liberation, for, instead
of making preparations in that direction, the
government initiated the most cruel persecutions
against the Protestants, compelling them to resort
to armed resistance. The struggle between the
Kuruczes, or the armed Hungarians, and the imperial
troops was at its height, when Kara Mustapha Pasha,
the ambitious grand-vizier of Sultan Mohammed IV.,
saw in this intestine war a favorable opportunity to
conquer the remaining territory of Hungary, and
even to menace in his own residence, Vienna, the
emperor of the Romans. Leopold I., the emperor
of Germany and king of Hungary, did all in his power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
to conciliate the Turks and to delay the war. But
Kara Mustapha remained inexorable, and boldly
ventured on an enterprise which was destined to be
fatal to him, and which, after a long and sanguinary
contest, finally led to the overthrow of the Turkish
power in Europe and the liberation of Hungary.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1683 the sultan and his grand-vizier
commenced their march at the head of a force
numbering 250,000 men, carrying with them 300
cannon. In Hungary they were joined by the so-called
Kurucz king, Count Emeric Tökölyi, and
his adherents. This tremendous army was already
under the walls of Vienna in July, but two months
of a severe siege had already elapsed and the city
could not be taken. The Christian forces, led by
John Sobieski, King of Poland, and Charles, Duke of
Lorraine, were meanwhile hastening to the relief
of the city, and on the 12th of September they succeeded
in completely routing the Turkish army, which
lost 60,000 men, the remainder scattering in wild
flight in every direction. This was the last great
campaign undertaken by the Osmanlis against the
Western world. They could never recuperate from
the effects of the defeat then suffered, and the great
calamity which befell the Turkish power rendered it,
at length, possible for Hungary, the bulwark of Christianity,
which had been the scene of continual wars
during a century and a half, to regain her liberty.</p>

<p>Leopold I., who had seen his capital menaced by
the Turks, now took energetic measures to continue
the war, and very soon his forces recaptured Gran,
the ancient seat of the primate of Hungary, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
for a long time had owned the Turkish rule.
The whole line of the Danube fell into the hands of
the Christians, and in 1684 an attempt was made to
capture Buda, the once famous capital of Hungary.
The siege, however, failed on this occasion, in spite of
the heroic efforts made by the Hungarians. But they
were more fortunate in the case of another powerful
Turkish stronghold, Neuhäusel (Érsekujvár), the recapture
of which, a brilliant military feat, was made the
occasion for feasting and merriment in many European
cities. At length, in 1686, Buda, too, was restored
to Hungary. Volunteers flocked into Hungary,
from every part of Europe, when the news spread
that Duke Charles of Lorraine, the commander-in-chief,
was making preparations for the recapture of
the ancient and famous seat of the Hungarian kings.
A powerful army gathered around his banners, and in
the middle of June the duke arrived under the
walls of Buda, which was defended by Abdi Pasha,
then seventy years old, and a garrison of 16,000
determined soldiers. The siege lasted seventy-seven
days, during which time the Turks made
two sallies, and the grand-vizier made three attempts
to come to the relief of the garrison, but the enemy
was each time driven back by the Christian forces.
The strongly fortified city, which had been heroically
defended, fell, at length, after five unsuccessful assaults,
on the 2d of September, 1686, into the hands
of Duke Charles. On the afternoon of that day,
at four o’clock, began the sixth assault; 9,000 Christian
heroes resolutely stormed with fixed bayonets
(an arm at that time still new and here employed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
the first time) the walls which had been reduced to
ruins by the guns of the besiegers. After a sanguinary
contest lasting about one hour, a gallant Hungarian,
David Petneházy, succeeded in penetrating,
first, with his 800 hayduks, into Buda, whose garrison
and inhabitants were almost entirely put to
the sword. Thus after a lapse of 145 years was
Buda freed from the Turkish yoke, and the whole
Christian world was jubilant over the glorious news.</p>

<p>Many bloody battles, however, occupying a considerable
period of time, had to be fought before the
Moslem oppressors were entirely swept away from
Hungarian territory. Duke Charles marched to
the southern parts of Hungary and destroyed the
Turkish army near Mohács, there, where 161 years
before the Hungarian army had been annihilated by
the Moslems. Soon after, Transylvania, too, passed
under the supremacy of the king of Hungary. All
the principal fortresses and towns were successively
occupied by the royal troops, and when, in 1691,
a Turkish army numbering 100,000 men was sent
again to Hungary by the Sublime Porte, they were
completely routed near Szalánkemén. It was one
of the most sanguinary battles of that century;
the grand-vizier himself, the aga of the Janissaries,
seventeen pashas, and 20,000 Turkish soldiers lost
their lives during the engagement. During a few
years succeeding this great battle, lesser engagements
only were fought, but hostilities never ceased. In
1697, however, Duke Eugene of Savoy, the “noble
knight” and illustrious general, assumed the commandership
of the royal forces. In the battle near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
Zenta he utterly annihilated, after a contest of two
hours, a Turkish army led by Sultan Mustapha II.,
inflicting frightful losses upon the enemy; 10,000
Turks met their death in the waters of the Theiss,
20,000 were killed, and among the dead were the grand-vizier,
4 pashas, and 13 begler beys. These successive
disasters and the frightful loss of men, amounting
to many hundreds of thousands in the course of
the fifteen years of warfare, finally prevailed upon the
sultan to accept the terms of peace proposed by Leopold
I. The treaty of peace was signed at Carlowitz
in 1699, and under its terms Transylvania and the
greater part of the Hungarian territory was restored
to the king of Hungary by the sultan, but a smaller
portion, lying between Transylvania and the Theiss,
the ancient county of Temes, was still permitted to
remain in Turkish hands. The court of Vienna, instead
of attempting to regain the remaining territory,
elated by the recent military successes, again
renewed its attacks upon the nationality of the Hungarians
and their ancient liberties, which it had always
looked upon with decided dislike, and the
complete subversion of which it now attempted.
The nobility, weary of the absolutism of the court,
combined at last with the peasantry, who had
suffered severely under the lawlessness and illegal
exactions of the soldiery, to raise the standard of rebellion,
under the lead of Francis Rákóczy II. The
great national struggle for liberty was initiated by
electing Rákóczy king of Hungary and Transylvania,
and, very soon, the Kurucz troops roamed as far as
Austria. Later on, however, the fortunes of war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
changed, and Rákóczy retired to Poland hoping
to obtain aid from the Russian Czar Peter the Great.
During his absence he entrusted one of his generals,
Alexander Károlyi, with the command of his army,
who, however, instead of continuing the struggle,
made his peace with the king. The peace of Szatmár,
in 1711, finally put an end to the period of constitutional
struggles between the nation and the king.</p>

<p>Now, at last, came the time for the still enslaved
Hungarian territory to be freed from Turkish rule.
The new war began in 1716. The imperial troops
were again commanded by Prince Eugene, who,
once more defeating the Turks near Peterwardein
wrested, at last, Temesvár and the county of Temes
from the Turks, in whose possession they had remained
one hundred and sixty-four years. At the
peace, concluded in 1718, the Sultan relinquished
also his claim to that part of the country, and thus
the entire territory belonging at the present day to
the crown of Hungary was at last freed from Turkish
thraldom.</p>

<p>There was now an end to the Islam rule in Hungary,
as there had been to the same rule in Spain.
But whilst the Moors had immortalized their name
by memorials of a grand civilization, leaving behind
them flourishing and wealthy cities, numerous works
of art, and marvels of architecture, the Turks left
Hungary ruined and devastated. Throughout the
whole territory of the reconquered country, only a
few miserable villages could be met with here and
there, population had sunk to the lowest ebb, endless
swamps covered the fertile soil of the once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
flourishing Alföld (Lowland), and the genius of the
Hungarian nation had now to engage in the arduous
labor of subduing, by the arts of peace and civilization,
the sterile waste they had regained at last by
their bravery and endurance. The work, hard as it
was, was done. For a century and a half the severe
task of colonizing and civilizing has been going on
bravely, until finally that tract of land, which they
recovered from the Turks an uninhabited desert, has
grown to be populous, flourishing, and one of the
richest granaries of Europe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br /><br />

<small>THE AUSTRIAN RULE, 1526-1780.</small></h2>

<p>The preceding chapter gave an account of the
varying fortunes of that part of Hungary which,
although geographically appertaining to the domains
of the crown of St. Stephen, was virtually occupied
and ruled by the Turks, and this account was
brought down to the time when the country succeeded
in shaking off the foreign yoke. The thrilling
episodes of that sad era deserved a place by
themselves. Yet in describing these tragic events
but little was said of the kings of the ruling dynasty
and the destinies of that portion of the country
which remained subject to their rule, or so much
only was touched upon in a general way as was
absolutely necessary for a proper understanding of
the occurrences related there. This hiatus will now
be supplied, by resuming, in a succinct form, the
historical narrative of the events following the disastrous
battle of Mohács.</p>

<p>We have already seen that at no time was the
Turkish power so strong as during the first half of
the sixteenth century, and that Hungary was never
so weak as after the death of Matthias Hunyadi.
The innovations of Matthias had broken down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
ancient military organization, which recruited its
armies from the ranks of the nobility and the armed
bands in their train, and established in its place a
standing army. But on the death of the genius
which had called it into existence, the standing army
also disappeared. We have described elsewhere the
sad fate of his valiant “black guard.” The disastrous
reverses at Belgrade and Mohács were the consequence,
and it became evident that Hungary,
single-handed, could not withstand the power of the
Osmanlis.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the nation was compelled
to look for assistance from abroad, and, in
searching for a powerful alliance, it was quite natural
that public attention should be drawn to the house
of Hapsburg, the great authority and influence of
which gave the fairest promise of effectual support
to the prostrate country. This dynasty occupied at
that time a front rank amongst the reigning families;
its rule extended over Austria, Germany, the wealthy
Netherlands, Spain, with her American colonies and
dependencies, Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia—an immense
domain, of which it might have been then truly
said that “the sun never set in it.” No dynasty, since
the Cæsars, had controlled the destinies of so many
nations and of so vast a territory. Ferdinand, a scion
of that influential dynasty, who at this time was also
elected king of Bohemia, owed his elevation to the
throne of Hungary to hopes and arguments of this
kind. He gave the people assurances of support on
the part of his family; he vowed to respect the rights
and liberties of the nation, and promised to live in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
country and to confide the conduct of her affairs to
Hungarians only.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="i360" id="i360">
<img src="images/i_360.png" width="400" height="267" alt="A CSIKÓS." />
<span class="caption">A CSIKÓS.</span></a></div>

<p>Every thing turned out quite differently from
what the royal electors had hoped and expected.
The Turks were decidedly averse to any augmentation
of the power of the Hapsburgs by the acquisition
of the Hungarian throne. They desired to see
Hungary under a separate king of her own, and to
accomplish this the Turks shrank from no sacrifices,
and succeeded in embroiling the unfortunate country
in continual wars. Unhappy Hungary was placed
between the hammer and the anvil. The Turks
were unwilling to yield, and the Hapsburgs, quite as
reluctant to give up the country, were, nevertheless,
unable to defend it. The result of the cruel war,
waged for over thirty years, was, in the end, that
Hungary was torn into three parts. The heart of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
the land, the Alföld, was seized by the Turks; the
hilly plateau of Transylvania was ruled by native
princes, acknowledging the suzerainty of the sultan;
and the remaining portion only, the northern and
western part, owned the supremacy of the Hapsburgs
in their capacity of kings of Hungary. Thus the
new dynasty, so far from proving a protection to
the country, rather led to its dismemberment.</p>

<p>The condition of Transylvania was, comparatively
speaking, more favorable than that of either of the
two other sections of the country. She had to pay
her tribute to the Turks, but beyond that she experienced
no interference on the part of her paramount
lord. She was allowed to elect her own rulers, to
convene her national assemblies, to keep up an army
of her own, and to live as before under the ancient
laws of Hungary. The Alföld, in the hands of the
Turks, was governed in Turkish fashion. The Turks
never settled down in the country they conquered;
they only garrisoned it, as it were. The government
and the spahis were the new landlords, and their chief
care was, not to watch over the welfare of the people,
but to fleece them and to extort from them heavy
taxes and all sorts of vexatious imposts. The effects
of such an administration became soon visible. The
ancient culture perished, the population gradually
decreased, and the once fertile soil relapsed into
barrenness.</p>

<p>Nor were the complaints fewer and less bitter in
the western and northern parts, ruled by the Hapsburg
kings of Hungary. The hope of obtaining,
through these kings, aid from the West gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
vanished. The nation, besides, was quick to perceive
that Hungary was looked upon by the Hapsburgs as
an unimportant province, rather than an independent
country. The king did not reside in Hungary, but
in Vienna, which was the permanent seat of his government,
and all the remonstrances coming from the
various diets against this state of things led only to
bare promises. There were numerous grievances
besides. After the first vacancy in the dignity of a
palatine no other palatine had been appointed, German
advisers alone were listened to in affairs concerning
Hungary, the country was flooded with
German officials and soldiers, and distinguished
Hungarian magnates were thrown into prison without
due form of law. These evils were already felt
under Ferdinand, the first Hapsburg king, but they
still increased under his successor, King Maximilian
(1564-1576). The latter proceeded quite openly in
his anti-national policy. He promised Germany for
himself and his successors, in return for her aid, to
use every endeavor to bring about the annexation
of Hungary to that country. The Diet of 1567,
in enumerating the many abuses of the government,
bitterly inveighed against the foreign soldiery,
charging them with arbitrarily raising tolls,
taking the thirtieth part, imposing unlawful taxes
on the communes, wasting the substance of the
peasantry and robbing them of their last penny,
and, finally, selling their children into slavery to the
Turks. The Diet declared that, “There is no salvation,
no hope for us; we have no other alternative
but to leave our native land and emigrate to foreign
parts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span></p>

<p>These complaints remained unheeded by Maximilian,
nor was his son and successor, Rudolph
(1576-1608), more disposed to remedy the ills complained
of. The office of the palatine still remained
vacant; the affairs of Hungary were administered,
without consulting the Hungarians, by a court cabinet
and a military council. Rudolph’s reply to the
remonstrances of the Estates of the realm, that
“these things have been in practice long since,” was
certainly a cynical apology for the continuance of
abuses. Thus was the continual infringement of the
law claimed to have become a law in itself, and independent
Hungary became virtually subject to the
authority of foreigners. The temper of the diets
which met during the first years of Rudolph’s reign
clearly indicated the state of irritation produced by
the king’s presumptuous treatment of the liberties
of the nation; the exasperated Estates spoke of refusing
to vote subsidies, and some of them, although
in the minority, threatened even to join either Poland
or Turkey. Rudolph, wearied with these boisterous
scenes, turned his back upon the country, and
the nation did not see her king for twenty-five years.</p>

<p>The country was compelled patiently to suffer the
encroachments on her ancient rights, for to no quarter
could she look for help. Alone she was too
weak to right herself, and the only alliances that offered
themselves were either the German or Turkish.
A sad alternative, indeed, for the Turks on the one
hand never ceased to harass and devastate the
country, threatening even to absorb the territory yet
free, and the Germans on the other utterly ignored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
the constitution and liberties of Hungary, although
the kings on their election and coronation always
swore to respect and to defend both. The Turks
were extirpating the nation, whilst the Germans
were trying to rob her of her Hungarian nationality.
The Germans, being considered the lesser
evil, carried the day, and hopes were besides entertained
that, after all, Germany would finally rid the
country of the Turks. These hopes were further
encouraged after the death of Solyman (1566), when
it became apparent that the Turkish power was declining
from day to day. But the country was
doomed to disappointment, for the Viennese government,
instead of arraying itself against Turkey, was
on the eve of trying the patience of her people again
with measures and acts hostile to their nationality.</p>

<p>The great obstacle to the Germanizing schemes
had always been the Hungarian Diet and the stiffnecked
independence of the nobles composing it.
It was impossible for the government to do away
with the diet as it had done away with the dignity
of palatine and the other exalted Hungarian offices,
as the grant of taxes and soldiers required in
an emergency depended upon the good will of the
diet. If there was no diet in session, no supplies
of money and soldiers could be voted. The government
therefore determined to resort to measures
which would bend the majority of the diet to its
will. The royal free cities had at that time the privilege
of sending members to the diet of Hungary to
represent them. But the influence at the diet of
these municipalities, of whom there were but few,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
and most of these with German inhabitants, was very
slight. A great number of private boroughs were
made by the government royal free cities, and an
attempt was made to use the new members sent by
these constituencies as a counterpoise to the hostile
nobles in the diet. But the nobility loudly protested
against this innovation. Some of those who protested
were charged with treason, but, unable to obtain their
conviction before a Hungarian tribunal, the government
had them brought to Vienna before a military
council, which pronounced them guilty of the charge
against them. One of the victims of these illegal
proceedings, a certain Illesházy, a wealthy magnate,
saved his life by flight only. His immense estates
were confiscated, and an inquiry into his case fully
proved that the cruel sentence passed upon him was
not meant so much to punish his supposed crime, as
it was intended to be a means of getting possession
of his vast property. But the persecutions of the government
did not stop there; the turn of the Protestants
soon came. Thus was one of the captains ordered to
take away by violence from the Protestants the cathedral
at Kassa, and to hand it over to the Catholics.
The city authorities of Kassa recaptured the church,
but it was taken from them again by force, and the city
was mulcted by the government in a heavy fine of
money. This outrage might well excite indignation
at a time when three fourths of the population of
Hungary were Protestants. It became evident that
the German influence was bent upon attacking the
people in their liberties as well as their religion, and
whilst the government was yet inclined to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
some indulgence to the Catholics, it was determined
to show no kind of mercy to the Protestants of the
country.</p>

<p>The excitement and indignation of the people,
throughout the whole land, at these lawless proceedings,
were reflected in the temper of the Diet
which met in 1604. They protested against the illegal
persecutions, stood up for the freedom of worship,
and warned the government not to stir up dissensions
amongst the followers of the antagonistic
churches. A fresh injury, however, was added to
those complained of, by Rudolph’s arbitrarily supplementing
the 21st article enacted by the Diet with
a 22d article, in which the Diet was enjoined from
discussing religious topics; intimations were thrown
out at the same time that heresy was to be persecuted.</p>

<p>This 22d article was the spark which set ablaze all
the inflammable material that had accumulated in
the country since the time that the Hapsburgs had
occupied the throne of Hungary. The North
of Hungary, allied with Transylvania, rose in arms,
and the entire Upper Country was soon gathering
in the camp of Stephen Bocskay, the prince of
Transylvania. The Turks favored the insurrection
and proclaimed Bocskay king of Hungary, bestowing
upon him, at the same time, a crown of gold. The
insurgents aimed at the entire overthrow of the
Hapsburgs, but the politic Bocskay opposed this,
being disinclined to deliver up the whole of Hungary
to the tender mercies of the Osmanlis. Bocskay
saw in the Germans a counterpoise to the overwean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>ing
power of the Turks and counselled a policy of
conciliation. The result of his counsels was the
peace of Vienna, concluded in 1606, in which the
abuses complained of were remedied, and constitutional
government and freedom of worship were
guaranteed for all time to come.</p>

<p>Remarkable as were the results of Bocskay’s rising,
they were quite eclipsed by the effects of the
astute policy inaugurated by him as the ruler of
Transylvania, a policy which he bequeathed to his
princely successors, enjoining upon them in his last
will always to adhere to it. It consisted in maintaining,
at all hazards, the independence of Transylvania,
in order to enable her, according to the necessities
of the moment, either to combine with the Turks
in defence of the Hungarian nationality against the
encroachments of Germanism, or joining the Germans
to keep, with their aid, the Turks out of the remaining
Hungarian territory. This course, marked
by rare political acumen and inspired by the purest
patriotism, was effectively aided by the mutual jealousies
of the Turks and Germans, and enabled the
Transylvanian princes ultimately to achieve their
noble aim of saving the liberties of Hungary, their
common country.</p>

<p>The terms of the peace of Vienna were soon forgotten
by the Viennese government, and its proselyting
Catholicism brought it again into collision with
the Hungarian Protestants. The successor of Rudolph,
Matthias (1608-1619), succeeded in restraining
to some extent the outbreaks of hatred by which the
various sectaries were animated, but hardly had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
succession to the throne of Bohemia been secured to
his cousin Ferdinand (II.), who had been brought
up by the Jesuits, and was their zealous pupil, than
the Czech Protestants took up arms, severed their
connection with the Hapsburgs, and inaugurated the
religious war which raged in Germany for thirty years,
and which stands in history unexampled for its
horrors (1618).</p>

<p>This movement could not leave Hungary indifferent.
In Hungary, too, Romanizing was being strenuously
carried on. The Jesuits gained a foothold in
the country, and bringing with them their schools,
books, and well-organized machinery they soon succeeded,
under the patronage of the government of
Vienna, in supplanting the Protestants. Peter Pázmány,
who, from a simple Jesuit, had risen to the
primacy of Hungary, was the life and soul of the
proselyting movement. He brought to the work of
Romanizing the country an irresistible eloquence, invincible
arguments in his writings, and unsurpassed
religious zeal. All the great powers of his mastermind,
and the resources of his enormous wealth
were employed by him to add to the Catholic fold.
By his own personal influence alone, thirty of the
most conspicuous Hungarian families returned to
the Catholic faith of their ancestors, families among
whom some owned domains larger than a dozen of
the smaller principalities of Germany. Protestantism
gradually lost ground, its followers became a minority
in the Diet, and the Catholics became daily more
arrogant. Under these circumstances the Protestants
of Hungary (where in 1618 Ferdinand was elected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
king, to succeed on the death of Matthias) could not
look on with unconcern when their Czech brethren
rose in arms nor could they permit their defeat by
the Catholic court, for such an event was sure to hasten
the moment when they, in their turn, would have to
resist the violent measures of coercion practiced now
against the Czechs.</p>

<p>They therefore joined the Czechs and took up
arms for the defence of their liberties, for freedom
of worship was with the nation closely interwoven
with the cause of constitutional liberty. Gabriel
Bethlen, who had become prince of Transylvania
in 1613, stood at the head of the movement. On
his first appearance on the scene of action, Bethlen
is thus spoken of by a Frenchman in a report to
his own government: “Bethlen is a distinguished
soldier who has taken part, in person, in forty-three
engagements; he is a man of wise judgment and
great eloquence * * * in short, the great Henry
IV. excepted, there is no king like him in the
world.” The high expectations entertained of his
abilities were not disappointed. The whole Upper
Country as far as Presburg passed into his hands during
the first year of the rebellion, and in 1620 he obtained
possession of the greatest part of the territory
beyond the Danube. But while he was carrying on
hostilities with such signal success, the Czechs were
completely routed by Tilly near Prague, and this
defeat cost Bohemia her independence. Bethlen,
being left without allies, hastened to make terms
with the Viennese government, and the result was
the Treaty of Nikolsburg, concluded in the beginning
of 1622, based upon the peace of Vienna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">HUNGARIAN PEASANTS.</span></a></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span></p>

<p>Bethlen, perceiving, with his wonted judgment,
that the dissensions among the Protestants of Germany
augured nothing favorable for the future, endeavored
to enter into amicable relations with the
court of Vienna. He used every means to prevail
upon it to abandon the persecution of the Protestants,
and to unite with him in a common war against the
Turks, in order to drive them from Hungary. But
the court was not disposed to listen to his overtures,
and seemed to consider it a matter of greater importance
to accomplish the destruction of Protestantism
than to free the country from the Turks. Bethlen,
seeing that all attempts in this direction were
doomed to failure, returned to the old policy of the
Transylvania princes. His political connections
reached as far as France, England, and Sweden, and,
upon the breaking out of the Danish war (1625), he
again began armed hostilities, which, however, although
crowned with victory, gave way to a new
treaty of peace, owing to the defeat of Bethlen’s
allies in Germany. When Gustavus Adolphus made
his appearance in the West, achieving victories for
Protestantism, the great Transylvanian prince was
no more amongst the living; he died in 1629. Bethlen
was, no doubt, one of the most conspicuous
figures in the history of Hungary. Through his exertions
little Transylvania moved, in politics, abreast
of the most powerful European nations, and under
him she became rich, powerful, and greatly advanced
in culture, and a strong prop to the rest of the Hungarian
nation. His premature death deprived the
country of the advantages which he certainly would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
have drawn from the triumphs of Gustavus Adolphus.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the Thirty Years’ War, the
prince of Transylvania, George Rákóczy I., took advantage
of the distressed position of Ferdinand III.
of Hapsburg (who had succeeded his father, Ferdinand
II., on his thrones in 1637) to strike a successful
blow for the liberties of Hungary. The beginning
of the reign of the successor of Ferdinand III.,
Leopold I. (1657-1705), witnessed the downfall of
Transylvania’s power.</p>

<p>This event disturbed the balance of power between
the Turks and Germans, and alone was
sufficient to bring about the great changes which
soon took place in the affairs of Hungary. In order
to account for the overthrow of the power of Transylvania,
it must be remembered that both the
Turks and Germans had for a long time back looked
askance at the strength and influence of this little
principality. They were filled with apprehensions
of having their Hungarian territories gradually absorbed
by Transylvania, and there was an agreement
between these two powers, to the effect that she
should not be allowed to add to her territory. It is
impossible to suppose that the then ruler of Transylvania,
George Rákóczy II., had no information of
this secret treaty, but he apparently paid no heed to
it, or entertained no fears as to its effects. He
quietly continued to extend his power, and for that
purpose entered into an alliance with the Swedish
king for the partition of Poland. In vain did the
Viennese court oppose this aggressive course, in vain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
did the Turks command him to desist from it; the
Transylvanian prince crossed the Carpathians, with
a gallant army, in 1657. The allied forces of Sweden
and Transylvania were everywhere victorious, and
the power of Transylvania stood higher than ever.
It was at this conjuncture that Leopold I., who had
succeeded Ferdinand III., inaugurated, at once, a
warlike policy, parting with the peaceable traditions
of his predecessors. Leopold divided the attention
of Rákóczy’s Swedish ally by setting on him his
ancient enemies, the Danes, and sent his own armies
into those Hungarian domains belonging to Rákóczy,
which the Transylvanian princes had extorted from the
Hapsburgs, in the treaties of Vienna and Nikolsburg,
and on other similar occasions. Nor were the Turks
behindhand in co-operating with the Hapsburgs. A
Tartar army was sent into Poland against Rákóczy,
and he himself was deposed from his princely office
as a punishment for his disobedience. Rákóczy,
thus left to fight his own battles, without an ally,
and hemmed in by Turks, Germans, and Tartars,
suffered defeat on every side, the flower of his army
fell into the hands of the Tartars, and it was only
by paying a large sum that he obtained peace from
Poland. When he returned to Transylvania in
August, 1657, with the wreck of his army, the principality
was involved in utter financial and military
ruin.</p>

<p>The Turks, however, did not pause here; they
wished to get the whole of Transylvania into their
possession. Twice the unhappy country was devastated
by Tartar hordes, and the inhabitants repeat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>edly
carried away into slavery by thousands; a
prince was given to her at the dictation of the
Turks, and part of her territory actually passed
under direct Turkish rule (1662). The hearts of the
patriotic Hungarians bled at this cruel sight, and
they appealed to and incessantly urged their king to
interfere, and not to allow the principality to perish.
Leopold I. turned a deaf ear to these appeals; he
was not inclined to venture on a war with Turkey,
on behalf of Transylvania, and was, at best, careful
to get his share of the common plunder. It was a
gloomy outlook for the Hungarian nation; the Turks,
on the one hand, oppressing her with their formidable
forces, and their own king languidly looking on.</p>

<p>The Turkish successes in Transylvania only served
to whet the Moslem appetite for further conquests.
In 1663 the Turks attacked Leopold without any
warning, and obtained possession of the region of
the Upper Danube, and of the lower valley of the
Vág. This was a great blow to Hungary, for the
conquered territory was thrust like a wedge into
the semicircular national territory, dividing it
again into two new parts. Although an imperial
army was sent to meet the Turkish forces, no
efforts were made to stay the continual advances
of the latter as long as they were on Hungarian territory,
but as soon as they neared the Austrian
frontier they were opposed by the imperial forces.
This imperial army achieved at St. Gotthard, near
the Raab, a brilliant victory over the Turks.</p>

<p>This victory gave fresh courage to the despondent
Hungarians. They now hoped that the war would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
be successfully pushed forward, and would end only
with the liberation of their country, and the less
sanguine expected at least a peace which would restore
to the possession of the king of Hungary,
Transylvania, and all the other territories obtained by
the Turks since 1657. A sad disappointment, however,
fell upon the country. The peace concluded
by the victorious government left in the possession
of the Turks all the territory they had previously
taken, thus virtually leaving the country in her former
maimed condition.</p>

<p>This disgraceful peace which had been concluded
by the court of Vienna without consulting the Hungarians,
at last shook even the faith of those Catholic
Hungarians who, until now, had been the unconditional
adherents of the Hapsburgs. They had,
heretofore, acquiesced in the forlorn condition of
their country, being persuaded that the Viennese
government lacked the ability of rescuing her, but
recent events showed them that it was lack of good
will on the part of the government which was precipitating
the ruin of the country. It became the
universal conviction that the Hapsburgs would gladly
see the country in the hands of the foreign invader,
in order to enable them, by reconquering her
anew, to do away with the uncomfortable trammels
of the national constitution. Leopold did not heed
the general discontent; he pursued the great aim he
had proposed to himself, of uniting, after the illustrious
example of Louis XIV., all the dependencies of
his dynasty into one homogeneous empire. Things
had come to such a pass in Hungary that the most in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>veterate
enemies of Turkey openly counselled amity
with the Turks, declaring that they preferred paying
a tribute to the latter rather than to see the country
go to ruin by the Germanizing machinations of the
Viennese court.</p>

<p>The general discontent soon budded into a conspiracy
in which, this time, not only the Protestants,
but chiefly the Catholic population took part, who
were now quite as eager to rid themselves of the
Germans. The heads of the conspiracy were all
Catholics. Their leader was Wesselényi, the palatine
of the realm and the king’s representative, and affiliated
with him in the leadership were the largest
landlords in the country: Peter Zrinyi, Nádasdy,
Francis Rákóczy, and Frangepán. Their aim was to
rid the country of the Germans by the aid of the Turks,
or, if possible, of the French. The conspiracy, however,
failed. Wesselényi died, and the plot was betrayed
to the government before it had ripened into
the intended rising. Leopold, without loss of time,
swooped down upon the principal conspirators.
Zrinyi, Nádasdy, and Frangepán were seized, and
without being given the benefit of the laws of their
country, were decapitated. Their immense estates
were confiscated, and Rákóczy himself could only save
his life and obtain mercy by paying a ruinous ransom
(1671). The government, however, was not satisfied
with the cruel punishment of the ringleaders alone;
it deemed this a propitious time for the introduction
of various oppressive measures. Without convoking
the Diet, a land and corn tax was imposed upon the
country, excise duties were introduced, and a poll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
tax levied on every inhabitant, including the nobles.
The land was swarming with a foreign soldiery
brought there to restrain the rebellious Hungarians.
The government added injury to insult; not satisfied
with insulting the nation by entirely ignoring its
constitution, and keeping down the national aspirations
by quartering foreign garrisons in national
territory, it raised illegal taxes wherewith to pay the
armed oppressors. The government at Vienna threw
off its mask at last; the Hungarian constitution was
abolished, and Hungary reduced to the condition of
a province of Austria (1673).</p>

<p>Whilst the government thus succeeded in subverting
the constitution of the country, it showed no less
activity and success in the prosecution of its other
aim, the Romanizing of the people. There was no
law to protect those professing the new faith; they
could be oppressed with impunity; their churches
were taken away from them; hundreds of their
ministers and teachers were sentenced by the tribunal
to slavery on the galleys, or were sent adrift by
private persecutions. It was an open secret that the
king himself was eager to exterminate the last
heretic, and just as the oath of the king to protect
the constitution had been forgotten, so were the
various treaties of peace, guaranteeing the freedom
of worship, doomed to oblivion, as soon as there was
no Transylvanian prince to recall them to royal
memory by force of arms.</p>

<p>And yet it was Transylvania, in her weakened
condition, that now came to the assistance of Hungary,
which had become a prey to Austrian rapacity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
Many of those who were compelled to fly from the
persecutions of the sanguinary policy of the government
sought and found a refuge in Transylvania,
and they were continually urging Apaffy, the prince
of Transylvania, and the Turks to intercede with
arms in behalf of the Hungarian cause. The Viennese
government assailed Stambul with letters requesting
the sultan not to allow Transylvania to be
the place of refuge of certain “thieves,” but to no
purpose. The Porte, indeed, so far from favorably
receiving these epistles, secretly promised aid against
the Austrians. A fresh insurrection broke out in
1672. The refugees flocked into the Upper Country
and inaugurated a warfare which, for cruelty and
mercilessness, stands alone in the history of Hungary.
The era of this contest, commencing in
1672, and covering a period of nearly ten years, is
called the <i>Kurucz-Labancz</i> era. This aimless and purposeless
struggle was kept up between the Kuruczes
(insurgents) and Labanczes (Austrians), within the
limits of the territory lying between Komárom and
Transylvania, and there was no end of the horrors
the contestants were guilty of in the course of
their hostilities against each other. To cut tobacco
on the enemy’s bare back, or to cut strips from his
quivering skin, to drive thorns or iron spikes under the
finger-nails, to bury him in the ground up to his head
and then fire at him, to skin him alive, to put a stake
through him,—in a word, to perpetrate tortures at
which humanity shudders, these were the every-day
courtesies exchanged between the two belligerents.
The combatants of that day respected neither God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
nor man; they acknowledged only one guide for their
actions: a bitter and undying hatred of all that
called itself <i>Labancz</i>. They were the misguided creatures
of a period during which the insane policy of
the government had robbed the people both of their
religion and their teachers.</p>

<p>The ruling powers had thus conjured up days of
terror, but were utterly inadequate to the task of
terminating them. Indeed after several years of
this schemeless struggle, the rebellion became at
last organized and conscious of a fixed object. The
rebels received aid from the French and from the
Porte, and Transylvania, as a state, was ready to make
common cause with her countrymen. Tökölyi, a
magnate of the Upper Country, a youth only twenty-one
years old, but of eminent abilities, placed himself
at the head of the rebels, and, now in 1678, began
the war in good earnest. The rebels soon became
masters of the Upper Country, and the government
which had been unable to cope with the headless
Kuruczes, proved quite helpless against the organized
rebellion, led by an able chief. Austria was, besides,
continually harassed by Louis XIV. in the west,
and, to add to her difficulties, it was rumored that
the Turks were preparing to invade Hungary with
an immense army, which, uniting with the forces
of Tökölyi, should drive the Austrians from the
country.</p>

<p>The government, thus driven to the wall, surrendered.
Negotiations soon began, the Diet was convoked
in 1681, and constitutional government and
freedom of worship were restored with a show of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
great alacrity. The concessions came too late. The
rebels had no faith in the government after the cruel
deceptions of which it had been guilty, and placed
no trust in promises wrung from its necessitous condition.
They refused to submit, and Tökölyi was
proclaimed by the Porte king of Hungary. The
threatened Turkish invasion became also in 1683
a fact. At this moment Hungary seemed to be lost
forever to the Hapsburgs; the whole country sided
with the Turks, the territory beyond the Danube
also acknowledging the authority of Tökölyi.</p>

<p>The destinies of Hungary, nay of all Eastern
Europe, hung upon the fate of besieged Vienna.
The siege of Vienna was raised through the victory
of Sobieski the Polish king; and the rapidly succeeding
victories of the Christian armies, already referred
to in the preceding chapter, awakened the hopes of
the Hungarian nation, and showed that, at last, the
emperor-king concerned himself in the liberation
from Turkish rule of Hungarian territory. The
decisive victories of Prince Eugene of Savoy finally
accomplished this, and the Turks henceforth gave up
all hopes of reconquering Hungary.</p>

<p>The liberation of the Hungarian soil, however important
in itself, proved no immediate panacea for the
ills of which the country had to complain. Even while
the struggle was going on, many things happened
which pointed to troubles in the future. The Hungarian
inhabitants along the course of the Danube were
rudely interrogated by the soldiers of the imperial
army of liberation as to what faith they professed,
and if they were found to adhere to the new tenets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
they were mercilessly set adrift. In the Upper
Country a certain Caraffa, the military commandant
of that district, committed acts of the most cruel
atrocity. This bloody monster pretended to have
discovered a conspiracy, and obtained from the government,
which was disposed to suspect the loyalty
of the Hungarians, full powers to deal with it and
to put it down. Caraffa made a terrible use of his
commission. He made wholesale arrests of the suspected
and loyal alike, threw into prison men of high
standing against whom he had a personal grudge,
and rich people whose property he coveted, and extorted
from them by dreadful tortures the confession
of crimes they had never committed. These unfortunates
were then executed upon the strength of
their confessions. This <i>bloody tribunal of Eperjes</i>, of
ill-fame, which inspired horror all over the land, continued
its malevolent functions until the first months
of 1687, when it was abolished, through the intercession
of the Diet which had just been convoked. This
Diet, however, was in most of its work not at all anxious
to hamper the government. On the contrary, it
displayed a pliability which made it forget the true
interests of the country. Thus it substituted for
the ancient right of the nation to elect their kings,
the hereditary right of succession in the male branch
of the Hapsburg dynasty, and it was this Diet that
relinquished the time-honored right of the people,
guaranteed by the Golden Bull, to resist with arms
any illegal acts of the king, without incurring the
penalty of treason for so doing. There were some
malicious critics who pretended that this unpatri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>otic
legislation was due to the pressure of imperial
guns pointed at the place in which the Diet met.
At all events the servile spirit exhibited by the
Diet gave color to the apprehensions of those
Hungarians who were of one mind with Tökölyi,
that Hungary must be irretrievably ruined if she
passed under the authority of the Austrians.</p>

<p>As the Turkish wars were drawing to an end, more
melancholy portents began to darken the horizon.
Hungary was reorganized by the government at
Vienna without the Hungarians being consulted.
Transylvania remained a separate “grand duchy,”
and the district beyond the Drave was formed into
a separate province, and all this was done from the
fear lest united Hungary might become too strong
to suit Austria’s schemes. A large portion of the
recovered territory was distributed amongst German
landowners, the southern portion of the Alföld was
colonized by Servians, and in other parts of the
land, especially in the cities, the settlement of German-speaking
people was encouraged, for the purpose
of tempering the hot blood of the rebellious
Hungarians. The fortified castles scattered throughout
the whole country, the property of private owners,
were blown up by the hundred, without the
consent of their proprietors, lest in case of a fresh
rising these strongholds should be used as centres of
a factious spirit.</p>

<p>The Protestants were not allowed to settle in the
reconquered districts. In other places the freedom
of their worship was interfered with, the churches
were taken from them, their ministers driven away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
and if any one, appealing to his constitutional rights,
had the courage to resist these illegalities, he was
thrown into prison. In a word, regular dragonnades,
as they flourished in France under Louis XIV., now
became the order of the day.</p>

<p>The government imposed upon the people such
oppressive and burdensome taxes that it almost
seemed as if it dreaded the prosperity of the country.
If the people complained of the heavy burdens,
they were instigated against the nobles, whose exemption
from taxation was pointed out as the only
cause of the heavy burdens. The country was again
flooded by a foreign soldiery, whose chief business
consisted in robbing and plundering, the common
soldiers oppressing the common people, and the
officers the nobility. The honor and the property
of the people were at the mercy of these brutal
troops, and those who complained of such outrages
found themselves always in the wrong. This forlorn
condition is reflected in many of the plaintive popular
songs of that period, but there was no means of
remedying these evils crying throughout the land,
for no Diet had been convoked since 1687. The aim
of the Viennese government became daily more
evident, to put the Austrian rule in the place of the
Turkish, and to ignore altogether the Hungarian
national aspirations. The nation herself seemed to
the government too much enfeebled and trodden
down to give any ground for apprehending any resistance
in defence of her rights, but to make assurance
doubly sure every effort was made to crush the
national spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the nation could not brook oppression, she
could not be kept quiet, deprived of constitutional
government, and as soon as she had found again a
leader in Francis Rákóczy II., she rose in arms.
The new leader was the bearer of a great name. His
ancestors had been princes of Transylvania. He
himself was the grandson of that George Rákóczy
II., who in 1657 invaded Poland, and subsequently
lost his life fighting against the Turks in defence of
his country and his throne. His father Francis had
taken part in the Wesselényi conspiracy, and escaped
the scaffold only at the cost of an immense
ransom. His maternal grandfather, Peter Zrinyi,
met with his death on the scaffold, and his only
great-uncle perished in prison in spite of his innocence.
His stepfather, Tökölyi, together with his
own mother, Ilona Zrinyi, ate the bitter bread of
exile in Turkey. He and his sister were, in their
early youth, torn from their parents, and their education
entrusted to Germans. In Vienna he was
subjected to many humiliations, and as he grew up
he left that city and retired to one of his estates, intending
to pass his life peacefully near his wife.
He was averse to action, and the bloody shades of
his family seemed vainly to beckon to him, who
alone bore yet the famous name and was the master
of immense possessions, to follow in their footsteps.</p>

<p>But all this was changed as soon as he came to
Hungary. He could not bear to witness the wrongs
perpetrated about him, and he could not move a
step without becoming aware that the nation expected
from him, the descendant of a line of heroes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
their salvation. Meanwhile the Spanish war of succession
had broken out in 1701, and very soon all
Europe was involved in it. This appeared to Rákóczy
to be a propitious time for the reconquering
of the liberties of the people, and, aided by the
French king, he hoisted in 1703 the flag of the rebellion,
bearing the inscription “pro patria et libertate,”
for the fatherland and liberty.</p>

<p>The sages at Vienna would not at first credit the
news of the rising of the people; they had long ago
made up their minds that such an event was impossible.
But when the movement spread like wildfire
throughout the Upper Country, Transylvania, and
ultimately all Hungary, and the great majority of
the nation unsheathed the sword, they became
frightened, and resorted to—negotiations and fresh
promises. The rebels were inclined to cease hostilities
provided their liberties were secured. But
mere words did not satisfy them now, having been
taught by sad experience the futility of royal words,
oaths, and solemn treaties of peace, and they therefore
endeavored to obtain more substantial guaranties
from the government. They exacted the independence
of Transylvania, under a Hungarian
prince and the guaranty of the European powers.
To these propositions the government neither would
nor could accede, while the rebels insisted upon their
first proposals, declaring that it was impossible for
them to have any faith in Austrian or—as it was
popularly termed—in German promises. This universal
sentiment of distrust, pervading the nation, is
admirably reflected in a popular song, to which that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a><br /><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>period gave birth, and of which we subjoin a translation:</p>

<p>These overtures failed to lead to peace, and the
struggle continued throughout the land, giving up
to ruin what had been left intact by the Turkish
slavery of a century and a half and the sixteen
years’ war of liberation. The government was unable
either to quell or to crush the rebellion, standing
in need of all its strength for the struggle in the
west. At this conjuncture Leopold I. descended
into his grave in 1705, and his well-intentioned son,
Joseph I., succeeded to the throne (1705-1711).</p>

<p>Joseph sincerely wished for peace, and, convinced
of the mistakes of the policy of his father, he did all
in his power to allay the apprehensions of the rebels,
but his constitutional sentiment failed to efface the
baneful effects of his predecessor’s misgovernment
and duplicity. Nor was it possible for him, either,
to accept the terms of the rebels, and thus it came
to pass that the dynasty of Hapsburg was dethroned
in Hungary, during the reign of this upright monarch,
in 1707. This was a great mistake on the part
of the rebels, but Joseph had now the advantage of
being able to show his respect for the liberties of the
nation, under the most adverse circumstances, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
he thus, by slow degrees, won the confidence of
the people. The French had, meanwhile, been
thoroughly defeated, and Joseph was thus enabled
to oppose larger forces to the rebels, while the latter
could not secure aid from any quarter. The rebels,
exhausted with the protracted struggle, met with
repeated defeats, and, to add to their distress, the
black plague made its appearance and fearfully
thinned the ranks of their troops. The king, however,
did not abuse his increasing power. He granted
an amnesty to all, without exception, who were willing
to return to their allegiance; he governed constitutionally,
remedied the ills inflicted upon the
country by his predecessors, and finally placed a
Hungarian commander-in-chief at the head of the
army. His earnest and sincere endeavors were at
last rewarded by peace. The issue of the various
negotiations was the compact of Szatmár, concluded
in 1711, by the terms of which a general amnesty
was granted, and constitutional and religious liberty
secured.</p>

<p>This peace was a grateful conclusion to the sad
days which had been weighing down Hungary for
two hundred years, a period during which both
Turks and Austrians were compassing the ruin of
the country. The former were perpetually threatening
her territorial integrity; the latter, her political
liberties, and the nationality to which those liberties
were closely wedded. By dint of rare courage, an
undying love of liberty, and acute statesmanship,
they succeeded in preserving both their territory and
their liberties. The sad events of those two centu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>ries
had put the endurance and energies of the nation
to the severest test, but, in the end, she triumphantly
passed through the cruel ordeal.</p>

<p>A new era now dawned in the history of Hungary.
Wars no more threatened the territory of the country,
and her liberties and nationality were no longer
exposed to stubborn violence. Yet the dangers to
her national life were not yet quite removed, for
what the sword and brute force had been unable to
accomplish during the preceding centuries, the
eighteenth century attempted to achieve peaceably
by means of the Western civilization.</p>

<p>Charles III. (Charles VI. as Emperor of Germany),
the brother and successor of Joseph, inaugurated
this new policy, and his daughter, Maria
Theresa (1740-1780), continued to pursue, during
her long reign, with great success, the course
traced by her royal father. The protracted wars,
whilst laying waste the country and reducing her
population, had also retarded her culture, and it
became now necessary to find means to remedy both
evils. Attempts were made to supply the lack of
population by colonizing. The Alföld, the special
home of the Hungarian race, was particularly depopulated,
and there we see the work of establishing
new settlements most zealously carried on during the
whole century. The Slavs from the Upper Country,
the Servians from the South, and multitudes of German-speaking
peoples from the West, soon spread
over the great plain, and the numerous villages of
the last could be met with at every step. The
government was especially solicitous in promoting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
German colonization, partly because these settlers
were industrious, and partly because this course
favored the Germanization of the country. But
soon the Hungarians, who had been crowded back
into the hilly regions of the country, returned to
their beloved Alföld, and for a while a regular hand-to-hand
fight ensued between them and the strangers
for the possession of the broad acres of the
fertile plain. Hardly one generation passed and all
those motley populations became Magyarized, and
proudly proclaimed themselves to be members of
the Hungarian community. Only there where the
foreign element had settled in compact masses, they
remained strangers still, but the national encroachment
on their borders went constantly on. In connection
with the colonization was also carried on
the work of draining the swamps and improving the
soil, and we see the population day by day increasing
in numbers and wealth.</p>

<p>Great changes, too, were effected in the country
by means of legislation. Successive Diets endeavored
to remedy the many palpable defects, and it
may be said that the tribunals existing up to 1848
originated in the time of Charles III. At this
period, also, was introduced the system of a standing
army and with it that of permanent taxation. Both
soldiers and taxes are still granted by the Diet, yet,
not for special emergencies only, as they arise, but
until the next Diet is convoked. About this time
the relations between Hungary and the Austrian
provinces were more clearly defined by the <i>Pragmatic
Sanction</i> of 1723. By it Hungary and the Austrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
provinces were declared inseparable, and the ruler of
both was always to be one and the same person from
the Hapsburg dynasty, in the regular order of succession
in the male and female lines; but, otherwise,
Hungary was to remain perfectly independent, and
was to be governed by her own laws.</p>

<p>The nation was offered an opportunity to prove
by her alacrity in complying with the wishes of
Charles in regard to a change in the order of the
dynastic succession, that his kind feelings towards
the country were fully reciprocated by the trustfulness
of the people. The right of succession was thus
extended to the female line too of those very Hapsburgs,
whose dynasty the nation, not many years
before, had declared to have altogether forfeited their
right to the throne. The country was soon called
upon at Maria Theresa’s accession to the throne to
prove by deeds its attachment and gratitude. The
young queen was attacked by all Europe, the enemy
being eager to rob her of the fairest portions of her
Austrian possessions. In this extreme danger she
appealed to chivalrous Hungary for protection, and
the nation, forgetting the old quarrels, exclaimed
with one voice: “<i>Vitam et sanguinem! moriamur
pro rege nostro Maria Theresia!</i>” Eighty thousand
soldiers went into the war to meet the queen’s enemies,
who were anxious to divide the spoils of the
empire, and during a combat of eight years the
Hungarians, whilst defending their Pragmatic Sanction,
upheld, at the same time, the integrity of the
Austrian possessions. The dynasty had thus won
in Hungary, by a spirit of conciliation, a country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
upon which it could count as a trusty support in
case of danger from without.</p>

<span class="caption">HUNGARIAN PEASANT.</span></a></div>

<p>Maria Theresa showed herself grateful for the
sacrifices and devotion of the nation. The district
of Temes, which had been retaken from the Turks
by her father, was re-annexed to the kingdom of
Hungary, and it was Maria Theresa who gave Hungary
the city of Fiume, in order that the country
might have a seaport town to promote her commerce
and industry. A great deal, too, was done
by her, in many ways, to improve the material condition
of the country, and still more for the advancement
of higher culture through the erection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
churches and the foundation and organization of
schools. In a word, she always remained, to her
end, the “gracious queen” of the nation.</p>

<p>A great social revolution had also taken place during
the reigns of Charles and Maria Theresa. The
magnates of the country deserted in the piping times
of peace their eagle’s nests on the rocky crests of the
hills and descended into the smiling valleys below,
building there palaces for themselves after foreign
patterns. Life in those rural abodes, owing to the lack
of pastimes and refinement, soon became dull to the
great lords, and, as there was no national capital to
offer distraction, they went abroad, and soon came
to like the foreign mode of life better than the lawlessness
of their country homes. The Viennese court
bade them welcome, overwhelmed them with distinctions,
and Maria Theresa, especially, understood the
art of fascinating them. Gradually they became foreigners
in their dress and manners, and all the Hungarian
that was still preserved by these absentees
was their names and the estates they possessed in
Hungary, the revenues of which they spent abroad.
The atmosphere and the graces of court life succeeded
in doing what the sword and violence had
failed to accomplish. The great lords became estranged
from their country and thoroughly Germanized.</p>

<p>If the great noblemen alone had still the exclusive
charge of defending the independence and nationality
of Hungary as they had done in days of old, then
indeed these blessed days of peace would have
brought ruin on both. It was fortunate, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
for the country that there was still left the gentry,
numbering hundreds of thousands, who, after the
peace of 1711, went on in their lives as before, and
concerned themselves, in their old way, with the national
affairs; the counties, where self-government
reigned supreme, being the scene of their action.
This class of nobles did not go abroad, nor was it
possible to subject any large numbers of them to the
fascinations of Viennese court life. They remained
at home, retained their Hungarian customs and
manners, their national language and dress, and
with these it was impossible to make them part.
Their counties were so many bulwarks of their nationality
and the independence of Hungary, and
these numerous seats of self-government furnished
the counterpoise to the Germanizing influences of
the court, which were thus destined, as far as the
nation as a whole was concerned, to come to naught
in times of peace, as they had failed before when
coercion was employed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br /><br />

<small>THE EMPEROR JOSEPH II. THE NATIONAL REACTION
AND THE NAPOLEONIC WARS.</small></h2>

<p>The royal crown of Hungary has ever been, from
the time it encircled the brow of St. Stephen, an
object of jealous solicitude and almost superstitious
veneration with the nation. It continued to loom
up as a luminous and rallying point in the midst of
the vicissitudes and stirring events of the history of
the country, during all the centuries that followed
the coronation of the first king. The people looked
upon it as a hallowed relic, the glorious bequest of a
long line of generations past and gone, and as the
symbol and embodiment of the unity of the state.
The different countries composing Hungary were
known under the collective name of the <i>Lands of the
Sacred Crown</i>, and, at the period when the privileged
nobility was still enjoying exceptional immunities,
each noble styled himself <i>membrum sacræ coronæ</i>, a
member of the sacred crown. In the estimation of
the people it had ceased to be a religious symbol,
and had become a cherished national and political
memorial, to which the followers of every creed and
all the classes without distinction might equally do
homage. Nor was the crown an every-day orna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>ment
to be displayed by royalty on solemn occasions
of pageant. The king wore it only once in his life,
on the day of his coronation, when he was bound
solemnly to swear fidelity to the constitution, before
the high dignitaries of the state, first in church, and
to repeat afterwards in the open air his vow to govern
the country within the limits of the law. Thus
in Hungary it has ever been the ancient custom, prevailing
to this day, that, on the king’s accession to
the throne, it is he who, on his coronation, takes
the oath of fidelity to his people, instead of the latter
swearing fealty to the king. The right of succession
to the throne is hereditary, but the lawful rule of the
king begins with the ceremony of coronation only.
It requires this ceremonial, which to this day is characterized
by the attributes of mediæval pomp and
splendor, to render the acts of the ruler valid and
binding upon the people; without it every public
act of such ruler is a usurpation.</p>

<p>During eight centuries all the kings and queens,
without exception, had been eager to place the crown
on their heads, in order to come into the full possession
of their regal privileges. Joseph II., Maria Theresa’s
son, who succeeded his mother in 1780, was the first
king who refused to be crowned. He felt a reluctance
to swear fidelity to the constitution, and to
promise, by a solemn oath, to govern the country in
accordance with its ancient usages and laws. The
people, therefore, never called him their crowned
king; he was either styled emperor by them, or
nicknamed the “<i>kalapos</i>” (hatted) king. His reign
was but a series of illegal and unconstitutional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
acts, and a succession of bitter and envenomed
struggles between the nation and her ruler. The
contest finally ended with Joseph’s defeat. He retracted
on his deathbed all his arbitrary measures,
and conceded to the people the tardy restoration of
their ancient constitution. The conflict, however,
had left deep traces in the minds of his Hungarian
subjects. It roused them from the dormant state
into which they had been lulled by the gentle and
maternal absolutism of Maria Theresa. Thus Joseph’s
schemes not only failed, but, in their effects,
they were destined to bring about the triumph of
ideas, fraught with important consequences, such as
he had hardly anticipated. The nation, waking from
her lethargy, gave more prominence than ever to the
idea of nationality, an idea which, as time advanced,
increased in potency and intensity.</p>

<p>Yet this ruler, who on ascending the throne disregarded
all constitutional obligations and waged a relentless
war against the Hungarian nationality, must
be, nevertheless, ranked amongst the noblest characters
of his century. Thoroughly imbued with the
enlightened views of the eighteenth century, and
those new ideas which had triumphed in the war of
independence across the ocean, he was ever in pursuit
of generous and exalted aims. He sincerely
desired the welfare of the people, and in engaging
in this fruitless conflict he was by no means actuated
by sinister intentions or by a despotic disposition.
To introduce reforms, called for by the spirit of the
age, into the Church, the schools, and every department
of his government, was the lofty task he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a><br /><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>imposed upon himself. A champion of the oppressed,
he freed the human conscience from its
mediæval fetters, granted equal rights to the persecuted
creeds, protected the enslaved peasantry
against their arbitrary masters, and enlarged the
liberty of the press. He endeavored to establish
order and honesty in every branch of the public
service, being mindful, at the same time, of all the
agencies affecting the prosperity of the people. In
a word, his remarkable genius embraced every province
of human action where progress, reforms, and
ameliorations were desirable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="i398" id="i398">
<img src="images/i_398.png" width="400" height="543" alt="HUNGARIAN PORTER." />
<span class="caption">HUNGARIAN PORTER.</span></a></div>

<p>Unhappily for his own peace of mind and for the
destinies of the nation he was called upon to rule,
he committed a fatal error in the selection of the
methods for accomplishing his humane and philanthropic
objects. He desired to render Hungary
happy, yet he excluded the nation from the direction
of her own affairs. He wished to enact salutary laws,
yet he reigned as an absolute monarch, unwilling to
call the Diet to his aid in the great work of reformation,
ignoring and disdaining the constitution and laws
of the country. He was impolitic enough to attack a
constitution which, thanks to the devotion of the
people, had withstood the shock of seven centuries.
He was unwise enough to suppose that the people,
in whose hearts the love of their ancient constitution
had taken deep root, for the defence of which rivers of
blood had been shed, could be prevailed upon to relinquish
it to satisfy a theory of royalty. The old political
organization was eminently an outgrowth of the
Hungarian nationality, and all classes of the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
including the very peasantry to whom the ancient
constitution meant only oppression, clung to it with
devoted fervor. The people were as anxious for
reforms as Joseph himself, but they wanted them
by lawful methods, and with the co-operation of the
nation and their Diet. Joseph might have become
the regenerator and benefactor of Hungary if he had
availed himself, for the realization of his grand objects,
of the national and lawful channels which lay
ready to his hand. But he, unfortunately, preferred
attempting to achieve his purpose out of the plenitude
of his own power, by imperial edicts and arbitrary
measures, thus conjuring up a storm against
himself which well-nigh shook his throne, and plunging
the nation into a wild ferment of passion bordering
on revolution.</p>

<p>The people presented a solid phalanx against Joseph’s
attacks upon their nationality and language,
which to them were objects dearer than every thing
else. They little cared for the emperor’s well-intentioned
endeavors to make them prosperous and happy
as long as he asked, in exchange, for the relinquishment
of their nationality. And this, above all,
was his most ardent wish. He wanted Hungary to
be Hungarian no more, and wished its people to cast
off the distinctive marks of their individuality, and to
adopt the German language, instead of their own, in
the schools, the public administration, and in judicial
proceedings. In a word, he made German the official
language of the country, and was bent on forcing
it upon the people.</p>

<p>Henceforth every reform coming from Joseph be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>came
hateful to the people. The oppressed classes
themselves spurned relief which involved the sacrifice
of their sweet mother-tongue. By proclaiming equal
rights and equal subjection to the burdens of the
state, he arrayed the privileged classes against his
person. The Protestants and the peasantry, who had
hailed him in the beginning as their new Messiah,
and fondly saw in his innovations the dawn of
brighter days, also turned from him as soon as he
attacked them in what they prized even more than
liberty and justice. It was not long before the
whole country, without distinction of class, social
standing, or creed, combined to set at naught the
Germanizing efforts of Joseph. The hard-fought
struggle roused the people, hitherto divided by antagonisms
of class and creed, to a sense of national
solidarity. It was during the critical days of these
constitutional conflicts that the foundations of the
modern homogeneousness of the Hungarian nation
and society were laid down.</p>

<p>The privileged classes looked upon Joseph, on his
advent to the throne, with distrust. They foresaw
that he would not allow himself to be crowned, in
order to avoid taking the oath of fidelity to the constitution
of Hungary. The first measures of his
reign concerned the organization of the various
churches of the country. He extended the religious
freedom of the Protestant Church. By virtue of the
apostolic rights of the Hungarian kings, he introduced
signal reforms into the Catholic Church, especially
regarding the education of the clergy, which
proved, in part, exceedingly salutary. He abolished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
numerous religious orders, especially those which
were not engaged either in teaching or nursing the
sick. One hundred and forty monasteries and nunneries
were closed by him in Hungary. The ample
property of these convents he employed for ecclesiastical
and public purposes and for the advancement
of instruction. He exerted himself strenuously and
successfully in the establishment of public schools
and in the interest of popular education. He removed
the only university of which the country
could then boast from Buda to Pesth, a city which
was rapidly increasing, and added a theological department
to that seat of learning. All these innovations
met with the approval of the enlightened
elements of the nation, whilst the privileged classes
and the clergy opposed them with sullen discontent.
The opposition was all the more successful, as the
emperor had contrived to insult the moral susceptibilities
of the common people by some of his measures.
Thus, with a view to economizing the boards
required for coffins, he ordered the dead to be sewed
up in sacks, and to be buried in this apparel. This
uncalled-for meddling with the prejudices of the
lower classes had the effect of creating a great indignation
among them, and of driving them into the
camp of the opposition. Trifling and thoughtless
measures of a similar nature impaired the credit of
the most salutary innovations. The people looked
with suspicion at every change, and, heedless of the
lofty endeavors of the emperor, everybody, including
the officials themselves, rejected the entire governmental
system of Joseph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span></p>

<p>The emperor also wounded the national feeling of
piety by his action concerning the crown he had
spurned. According to ancient custom and law the
sacred crown was kept in safety in Presburg, in a
building provided for that purpose. In 1784 the
emperor ordered the crown to be removed to Vienna,
in order to be placed there in the royal treasury
side by side with the crowns of his other lands.
The nation revolted at this profanation of their hallowed
relic, and the highest official authorities,
throughout the land, protested against a measure
which, while it created such widespread ill feeling,
was not justified by any necessity. A dreadful storm,
accompanied by thunder and lightning, was raging
when the crown was removed to Vienna, and the
people saw in this a sign that nature herself rebelled
against the sacrilege committed by the emperor.
The counties continued to urge the return of the
crown in addresses which were sometimes humbly
suppliant in their tone and sometimes threatening,
but Joseph did not yield either to supplications or
menaces.</p>

<span class="caption">SLOVAK WOMAN AND CHILDREN.</span></a></div>

<p>When the edict, which made German the official
language of the country, was published, the minds of
men all over the country were already greatly disturbed.
It is true, that hitherto the Latin and not
the Hungarian language had been the medium of
communication employed by the state. But the national
spirit and the native tongue, which during the
first seventy years of the eighteenth century had
sadly degenerated, were awakening to new life during
Joseph’s reign. The literature of the country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a><br /><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>began to be assiduously cultivated in different spheres.
Royal body-guards belonging to distinguished families,
gentlemen of refinement, clergymen of modest
position, and other sons of the native soil labored with
equal zeal and enthusiasm to foster their cherished
mother-tongue. It would, therefore, have been an
easy matter for Joseph to replace the Latin language,
which had become an anachronism, by the Hungarian,
and thus to restore the latter to its natural and
legal position in the state. He was perfectly right in
ridding the country of the mastery of a dead tongue,
but he committed a most fatal error in trying to substitute
for it the German, an error which avenged
itself most bitterly. Joseph entertained a special
antipathy to the Hungarian tongue, a dislike which
betrayed him into omitting the teaching of the native
language from the course of public instruction, and
refusing to allow an academy of sciences to be established
which had its cultivation for its object.</p>

<p>The emperor’s attack upon the language of the
nation irremediably broke the last tie between him
and the country, and, henceforth, the relations between
them could be only hostile. The counties assumed
a threatening attitude, some of them refusing
obedience altogether. Thus most of them declined
to give their official co-operation to the army officers
who had been delegated by the emperor to take the
census. The count, nevertheless, proceeded, but in
many places the inhabitants escaped to the woods,
and in some there were serious riots in consequence
of the opposition to the commissioners of the census.
A rising of a different character took place amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
the Wallachs. The Wallachs, smarting under abuses
of long standing, buoyed up by exaggerated expectations
consequent upon the emperor’s innovations,
and stirred up by evil-minded agitators, took
to arms and perpetrated the most outrageous atrocities
against their Hungarian landlords. The ignorant
common people were assured by their leaders, Hora
and Kloska, that the emperor himself sided with
them. The Wallach insurgents assassinated the
government’s commissioners sent to them, destroyed
60 villages and 182 gentlemen’s mansions, and killed
4,000 Hungarians, before they could be checked in
their bloody work. Although they were finally
crushed and punished, a strong belief prevailed
in the country that the court of Vienna had been
privy to the Wallach rising.</p>

<p>Joseph subsequently laid down most humane rules
regulating the relations between the bondmen and
their landlords. But the country could not be appeased
by any boon, especially as the high protective
tariff, just then established for the benefit of the Austrian
provinces, was seriously damaging the prosperity
of the people. Joseph’s foreign policy tended to
increase the domestic disaffection. In 1788 he declared
war against Turkey, but the campaign turned
out unsuccessful, and nearly terminated with the emperor’s
capture. The nation, emboldened by his defeat,
urged now more emphatically her demands, and
requested the emperor to annul his illegal edicts, to
submit to be crowned, and to restore the ancient
constitution. Joseph continuing to resist her demands,
most of the counties refused to contribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
in aid of the war either money or produce. In addition
to their recalcitrant attitude, they most energetically
pressed the emperor to convoke the Diet at
Buda, a few counties going even so far as to insist
upon the Chief Justice’s convoking it, if the emperor
failed to do so before May, 1790.</p>

<p>The courage of the nation rose still higher when
the news of the revolution in France and the revolt
in Belgium reached the country. The people refused
to furnish recruits and military aid, and the emperor
was compelled to use violence in order to obtain either.
The counties remained firm and continued to remonstrate
in addresses characterized by sharp and energetic
language. Joseph yielded at last. He was prostrated
by a grave illness, and feeling his end approaching
he wished to die in peace with the exasperated nation
he had so deeply wounded. On the 28th of
January, 1790, he retracted all his illegal edicts, excepting
those that had reference to religious toleration,
the peasantry, and the clergy, and re-established the
ancient constitution of the country. Soon after he
sent back the crown to Buda, where its return was
celebrated with great pomp, amidst the enthusiastic
shouts of the people. Before he could yet convoke
the Diet death terminated the emperor’s career on
the 20th of February. The world lost in him a great
and noble-minded man and a friend to humanity,
who, however, had been unable to realize all his
lofty intentions. The effect of his reign was to
rouse Hungary from the apathy into which it had
sunk, and at the time of Joseph’s death, the minds of
the people were a prey to an excitement no less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
feverish than that which had seized revolutionary
France at the same period.</p>

<p>But while in Paris democracy was victorious over
royalty, the latter had to yield in Hungary to the
privileged nobility. The restored constitution was
a charter of political privileges for the nobles only,
and as such was most jealously guarded by them.
This class kept a strict watch over the liberal tendencies
of the age, preventing the importation of democratic
ideas from France from fear of harm to their
exclusive immunities.</p>

<p>Joseph was succeeded by his brother, Leopold
II., who until now had been Grand Duke of
Tuscany. The new ruler was as enlightened as
his predecessor, and had as much the welfare
of the people at heart; but he respected, at the
same time, the laws and the constitution. He immediately
convoked the Diet in order to be crowned,
and by this act he solemnly sealed the peace with
the nation. The people hailed with joy this first
step of their new king, and there was nothing in the
way of their now obtaining lawfully from the good-will
of the king the salutary legislation which Joseph
had attempted to force arbitrarily upon them. But
the fond hopes in this direction were doomed to
disappointment. The national movement had not
helped to power those who were in favor of progress,
equality of rights, and democracy. No doubt there
were people in the country who differed from the
men in authority, who were sincerely attached to
the doctrines of the French Revolution and eager to
supplant the privileges of the nobles by the broader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
rights belonging to all humanity. The national literature
was in the hands of men of this class. They
combated the reactionary spirit of the nobility, and
contended for the recognition of the civil and political
rights of by far the largest portion of the people,
the non-nobles. They boldly and with generous enthusiasm
wielded the pen in defence of those noble
ideas, and indoctrinated the people with them as
much as the restraints placed upon the press allowed
it at that period. They succeeded in obtaining recruits
for their ideas from the very ranks of the
privileged classes, and many an enlightened magnate
admitted that the time had arrived for modernizing
the constitution of Hungary by an extension of
political rights. Their number was swelled also by
the more intelligent portion of the inhabitants of the
cities, and those educated patriotic people who,
although no gentle blood flowed in their veins, had
either obtained office under Joseph’s reign or had
imbibed the political views of that monarch. But
all of these men combined formed but an insignificant
fraction of the people compared to the numerous
nobility, who, after their enforced submission
during ten years, were eager to turn to the advantage
of their own class the victory they had achieved over
Joseph. During the initial preparations for the
elections to the Diet, and in the course of the elections,
sentiments were publicly uttered and obtained
a majority in the county assemblies, which caused a
feverish commotion amongst the common people
and the peasantry. The latter especially now eagerly
clung to innovations introduced by the Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
Joseph, so beneficial as regarded their own class, and
were reluctant to submit to the restoration of the
former arbitrary landlord system. Their remonstrances
were answered by the counties to the effect
that Providence had willed it so that some men
should be kings, others nobles, and others again
bondmen. Such cruel reasoning failed to satisfy
the aggrieved peasantry. Symptoms of a dangerous
revolutionary spirit showed themselves throughout
a large portion of the country, and an outbreak
could be prevented only by the timely assurance, on
the part of the counties, that the matter would be
submitted to the Diet about to assemble.</p>

<p>The Diet, which had not been convened for twenty-five
years, opened in Buda in the beginning of June,
1790. The coronation soon took place. Fifty years
had elapsed since the last similar pageant had been
enacted in Hungary. After a lengthy and vehement
contest extending over ten months, in the course of
which the Diet was removed from Buda to Presburg,
the laws of 1790-1791, which form part of the
fundamental articles of the Hungarian constitution,
were finally passed. By them the independence of
Hungary as a state obtained the fullest recognition.
The laws, which were the result of the co-operation
of the crown and the Estates, declared that Hungary
was an independent country, subject to no other
country, possessing her own constitution by which
alone she was to be governed. Important concessions
were also made to the rights of the citizens of
the country. The privileges of the nobility were
left intact, but the extreme wing of the reactionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
nobles had to rest satisfied with this acquiescence in
the former state of things, and were not allowed to
push the narrow-minded measures advocated by
them. The majority of the Diet was influenced in
their wise moderation, partly by the exalted views of
the king, and to a greater extent yet by the disaffected
spirit rife amongst the people, and especially
threatening amongst the Serb population of the
country. The laws secured the liberties of the Protestant
and the Greek united churches, remedied the
most urgent griefs of the peasantry, and declared
those who were not noble capable of holding minor
offices. Although the most important measures of
reform were put off to a future time by the diet of
1790-1791, several preparatory royal commissions
having been appointed for their consideration, yet
the work it accomplished was the salutary beginning
of a liberal legislation which culminated, not quite
sixty years later, in the declaration of the equal
rights of the people as the basis of the Hungarian
commonwealth.</p>

<p>After the meeting of this Diet, however, very little
was done in the direction of reforms. The good
work was interrupted, partly by the premature death
of Leopold II. (March 1, 1792), and partly by the
warlike period, extending over twenty-five years,
which, in Hungary as throughout all Europe, claimed
public attention, and diverted the minds of the leaders
of the nation from domestic topics. Francis I.,
the son and successor of Leopold II., caused himself
to be crowned in due form, and much was at first
hoped from his reign. But the Jacobin rule of terror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
in Paris, and the dread of seeing the revolutionary
scenes repeated in his own realm, wrought a complete
change in his character and policy. He soon
stubbornly rejected every innovation, and gradually
became a pillar of strength for the European reaction,
that extravagant conservatism which expected
to efface the effects of the French Revolution by an
unquestioning adherence to the old and traditional
order of things. This illiberal spirit of the monarch
rendered impossible for the time any further reform-movement
in Hungary. Every question of desirable
change met with the most obstinate opposition on
the part of the king, and the reforms submitted by
the royal commissions were considered by every successive
Diet without ever becoming law. The period
which now followed was gloomy in the extreme, as
well for Hungary as for the Austrian provinces of
Francis I. The inhabitants of these countries were
constantly called upon by the king in the course of
the wars to make sacrifices in treasure and blood, by
furnishing recruits and by paying high taxes. At
the same time the government resorted to the most
absolute and arbitrary measures to prevent the people
from being contaminated with French ideas.
The press was crushed by severe penalties. Every
enlightened idea was banished from the schools and
expunged from the school-books. Only men, for
whose extreme reactionary spirit the police could
vouch, were appointed to the professorships or to
other offices. A system of universal spying and secret
information caused everybody to be suspected and
to suffer from private vindictiveness, whilst those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
who dared to avow liberal views were the objects of
cruel persecution.</p>

<p>The numerically few but staunch adherents of
democracy, being thus debarred from openly laboring
for their views, endeavored to accomplish their
purposes by secret combinations. A secret society was
formed in Pesth, the centre of the political life of the
country. This league of Hungarian Jacobins had
but a confused idea of its own aims, and of the
means of achieving them. They produce, at this
distance of time, the impression of an organization,
indulging in crude, exaggerated, and even thoughtless
visions, but theirs, nevertheless, is the credit of
having been the first society of the kind in the
country, and of thus furnishing a link in the political
development of the public spirit in Hungary. Although
the members of the league were unable to
secure any tangible results, yet they deserve a place
in the national history as the first martyrs of universal
freedom and human rights in Hungary, for they
forfeited their lives or suffered long imprisonments
for the holy cause. The movement was originally
planned by Ignatius Martinovics, a learned abbot
who entered into relations with the Jacobins abroad,
first with those of Paris, and afterwards with their
sympathizers in Germany and Austria. With the
assistance of these he intended to bring about a
republic of Hungary, and to establish there the
doctrines of equality and liberty. He organized
for that purpose a secret society in Pesth, after
the pattern of the masonic societies, which were
then flourishing throughout the country. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
were in point of fact two distinct associations, one
called <i>the reformers</i>, the other styled <i>the friends of
liberty and equality</i>. The former knew nothing of
the designs of the latter, whilst these, occupying a
higher rank, were fully initiated into the secrets of
the reformers. The aim of both alike was to insure
the triumph of the principles of the French Revolution.
The members recognized each other by secret
signs, and used in their correspondence a cipher devised
for the purpose. Martinovics’ scheme was to
hoist the revolutionary flag as soon as the increased
number of members in both societies might render
such a step advisable. Meanwhile the sole business
of the members consisted in spreading among the
people a catechism conceived in a revolutionary
spirit.</p>

<p>Martinovics commenced the organization of the
secret society in the spring of 1794. He was assisted
in his work by John Laczkovics, formerly a captain
in the army, Joseph Hajnóczi, an ex-<i>alispán</i> (vicecomes
or deputy sheriff of a county), and Francis
Szentmarjay, a young man of distinction, who were
all zealously engaged in recruiting members for the
new association. Among the latter, however, but few
knew of Martinovics’ ultimate object, or of his
French connections. Most of them thought that it
was his intention to secure the introduction of reforms
by lawful means. As to the secret character
of the society, they looked upon it as a concession
to the fashion of the period, introduced by the freemasons.
During the eighteenth century a real mania
for secrecy of this kind prevailed all over Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
and secret societies sprang up in every quarter for
purposes which, if publicly proclaimed, would have
met with no opposition whatever. The society of
the Hungarian Jacobins did not owe its existence to
subversionary tendencies, but to that eagerness for
reforms which never ceased to agitate the nation.
With the exception of a dozen unreflecting men who
dreamt of overthrowing the Hungarian monarchy
with the aid of the French, the rank and file were
entirely composed of men who believed in reforms
achieved by lawful methods. The leaders themselves,
Martinovics, Hajnóczi, and Laczkovics, had
filled important offices under the Emperor Joseph,
and had subsequently supported King Leopold
in his efforts at reform. If Leopold had lived,
every one of them would have borne a conspicuous
part in public affairs. But the triumph of the reactionary
spirit under the reign of King Francis
made them conspirators. Those of their friends
who joined them were all honest and enthusiastic
patriots, who saw in the success of democratic ideas
the welfare of Hungary. But they did not look to
a revolution for the realization of their fond hopes.
They entered the society for the sole purpose of
preparing the minds of their countrymen for reforms
to be obtained by constitutional means. Almost
every Hungarian writer, who was not in some dependent
position, belonged to the society. Amongst
these was Francis Kazinczy, the regenerator of Hungarian
literature, and one of the most respectable
members of the literary guild. The French ideas
found a grateful echo among the intelligent elements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
of the country. The reports of French victories
were hailed with joy in the capital, by the professors
at the university, and the students, as well as by
people in the country, especially in the county of
Zemplén, the home of Kazinczy. Liberty poles were
erected in several places, many hoping that the victories
of the French would establish in Hungary the
reign of liberty and equality. These demonstrations,
however, were entirely independent, and were not
inspired by Martinovics. Such occurrences reflected
only the effect of foreign events on the public mind
of Hungary, which had at all times been open to
influences from abroad, and which did not fail, in
this instance, to respond to the voice of humanity
which then rang out through a large portion of the
Western world.</p>

<p>The secret society confined its work to procuring
fresh members and to a wide distribution of their
political catechisms. The number of the members
amounted altogether to seventy-five, of whom twenty-seven
lived in Pesth, and the remainder belonged to
every part of the country. Only three months had
elapsed after the organization of the society when
Martinovics was arrested in Vienna, and Laczkovics,
Szentmarjay, and Hajnóczy in Pesth. The Viennese
police had discovered the Austrian fraternity, and,
finding Martinovics amongst its leaders, detained
him at once. Martinovics while in prison made a
full confession of every thing, and the arrests in Hungary
were the consequence. About fifty men were
thrown into prison. At the time of their arrest, the
distribution of a few revolutionary pamphlets ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>cepted,
no deed, subversive of the public order,
could be traced to the secret society of which they
were members. It was therefore hoped that the
government, in punishing them, would act with
moderation and humanity. King Francis disappointed
such hopes. He ordered them to be prosecuted
without mercy, being determined to set a terrifying
example, and, by inaugurating a reactionary
reign of terror, to discourage his subjects from sympathizing
with French ideas. Eighteen prisoners
were sentenced to death, but Martinovics and six of
his companions only were executed. They lost their
heads by the executioner’s sword on the meadow in
Buda, a spot called to this day the field of blood.
The remaining prisoners, with few exceptions, were
sentenced to longer and shorter terms of imprisonment,
and two of the suspected escaped arrest by
suicide. Francis Kazinczy suffered severe imprisonment
in an Austrian dungeon during eight long
years, and numerous other Hungarian writers were
similarly deprived of their liberty.</p>

<p>These bloody executions created widespread dismay
in the country. No one felt safe, for everybody
was ignorant of the nature of the crimes with which
the unhappy victims had been charged. The counties
remonstrated, in addresses sent to the king,
against these cruel proceedings, but without any
effect. Francis pensioned off five liberal professors
at the university, interdicted the teaching of Kant’s
philosophy at that seat of learning, began to persecute
every enlightened man in the country, and especially
delighted in vexing in every possible way the intelli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>gent
element of Zemplén County. The friends of
liberty, the men of progress, were thoroughly frightened.
The press, too, was fettered by the government,
and thus, by degrees, public life in Hungary
became torpid and stagnant, the adherents of reform
were reduced to silence, and innovations had to bide
their time. The reactionary government achieved a
complete victory. It banished from the high offices
even the most moderate men, and filled every place
of importance with persons who delighted in relentlessly
repressing every democratic impulse in Hungary.</p>

<p>The Diets which met during this period paid no
attention whatever to reforms. Their main function
consisted in voting considerable supplies in money
and soldiers for the war against the French. The
Hungarian nation sacrificed a great deal for her king
during the Napoleonic wars, and, when the hostile
armies were approaching the border of the country,
every noble personally took up arms to defend the
throne of his crowned king with his life and blood.
The gentry distinguished themselves by their devotion,
especially in 1809. Napoleon made the Hungarians
the most enticing offers in order to seduce
them from their allegiance to King Francis. He
called upon them by proclamation to abandon Francis,
to elect, under the French protectorate, a king
of their own, and to restore Hungary to complete
independence. But the Hungarian nation remained
unshaken in their devotion to the king, and rallied
round him and the ancient dynasty. The French,
failing in their scheme, entered Hungary. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
Hungarians gallantly defended their native soil,
but were defeated near Raab, owing to the incapacity
of their Austrian generals. During the whole
Napoleonic contest, to its termination, in 1815, Hungary
made immense sacrifices for the royal throne,
and thousands of her sons shed their blood in its
defence, on the most distant battlefields of Europe.</p>

<p>Francis but scantily rewarded the fidelity of the
nation. He always had words of praise for the
Hungarians, but constantly put off remedying the
evils they complained of. The long wars, paralyzing
commerce and trade, had fatally affected the prosperity
of the country. The government, in order to
meet the expenses of the continuous wars, had issued
paper money to such an enormous extent that the
paper currency became completely depreciated. The
depreciation of one florin to one fifth of its face value
was subsequently officially promulgated by the government,
causing thereby immense losses to the people.
To these miseries were added the numerous
illegal acts and arbitrary and unconstitutional proceedings
of the government, which continued even
after Napoleon had been safely chained to the rock
of St. Helena and peace began anew to dawn upon
the world. The reign of reaction and absolutism
which set in in Europe in 1815 extended its baneful
influence also over Hungary. The constitution was
completely ignored by the king and no Diet was convened.
These were sad days for Hungary. There
was no one to promote her national interests, and
her advancement in culture was hampered by the
meddling rule of the Austrian police. And, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>deed,
had not, about this time, the national literature
infused a fresh and hopeful spirit into the body
politic, Hungary would have presented a most deplorable
picture of apathy and despair. Literature,
science, and poetry, the cultivation of which was sadly
interrupted by the imprisonment of most of their
votaries in 1795, in consequence of the Martinovics
conspiracy, became powerful agencies in rousing the
nation to renewed political activity. Numerous distinguished
writers sprang up, exerting themselves to
inculcate lessons of patriotism and national self-respect
into the minds of the people who had been
arbitrarily debarred from the most telling influences
of legitimate culture by the Viennese government.
The latter at last thought that the time had arrived
when the absolute government prevailing in her
Austrian dominions might be established with safety
also in Hungary. The first attempt made by
King Francis in this direction was to levy, arbitrarily,
solely by his own authority and without the consent
of the Diet (which was necessary under the law),
35,000 recruits for the army. This illegal exaction
of the king created a tremendous commotion amongst
the people, and resulted in a most desperate conflict
between the Hungarian nation and the Viennese
government. The political contest which lasted
five years newly inflamed the national enthusiasm.
King Francis finally saw the error of his ways, acknowledged
the illegality of his action, and returned
to constitutional government. He summoned the
Diet, in 1825, which, continuing the work of reform
checked in 1791, gave the impulse to a new era of
modern progress in Hungary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br /><br />

<small>SZÉCHENYI, KOSSUTH, AND THE STRUGGLE FOR
LIBERTY IN 1848-1849.</small></h2>

<p>On one of the most picturesque positions in Buda-Pesth,
on the left bank of the majestic Danube, stands
the bronze statue of Stephen Széchenyi, the greatest
Hungarian of this century. The piety of the nation
has placed it in the midst of her most conspicuous
creations. At its feet rolls the mighty river whose
regulation was commenced by Széchenyi, who made
it a line of communication in the commercial system
of Europe; in front is seen the grand suspension
bridge, and beyond it is visible the mouth
of the tunnel which, piercing the castled mountain
of Buda, connects the dispersed parts of the city.
In the rear rise the palatial edifices of the Hungarian
Academy of Sciences, which owes its existence
to Széchenyi’s munificence, and round about
stretches noisy, surging Buda-Pesth, to whose embellishment
and enlightenment no one ever devoted
himself so zealously as Stephen Széchenyi. Every
thing surrounding the statue reminds us of the transcendent
genius of Széchenyi, who raised for himself
by his indefatigable labors, which form a link between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a><br /><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>old and modern Hungary, a monument more lasting
and grander than the one cast in bronze.</p>

<p>Stephen Széchenyi was born on the 21st of September,
1791. He was the scion of a family which
had given many distinguished men to their country,
and with whom patriotism was traditional. His
father, Count Francis, was the founder of the greatest
institute of Hungary, having public culture for
its aim, the National Museum of Buda-Pesth, which is
now reckoned one of the finest and richest of the
kind in Europe. Count Francis clung with passionate
devotion to the cause of his country. The tender
mind of his son Stephen was often puzzled to
see his father melancholy and lost in thought, and
later only, when grown to manhood, did he learn
that his father had been grieving over the backwardness
of his country. Count Stephen inherited the
patriotic sentiments of his father, and never for a moment
lost sight of the one great object of his life, to
revive the now decaying nation, which had acted so
proud a part in the past, and to secure for her a
better future by promoting her material and cultural
interests. Stephen Széchenyi became the apostle of
this patriotic mission; he devoted his whole life to
this one lofty thought, studying for many years, reflecting,
travelling, gathering knowledge, and when
the hour arrived to enter upon the scene of action,
he took the lead of the nation, aptly equipped for
the severe task.</p>

<span class="caption">OLD GYPSY WOMAN.</span></a></div>

<p>He finished his studies under the roof of his father,
who was a man of high culture. The turmoils of
the Napoleonic wars, shaking all Europe and with it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a><br /><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>Hungary, allowed but scant opportunity for peaceful
avocations when Count Stephen had reached his
sixteenth year. He accordingly entered the army
and gallantly took part, as a young officer, in the
wars of the period, being present at the famous
battle of Leipsic. The Congress of Vienna put an
end to the wars which had raged in Europe for
twenty-five years, and during the protracted period
of peace following it, Széchenyi bestowed his attention
upon the affairs of his country. Before taking
an active part, however, he travelled for a considerable
time through Italy, France, and England, and
only after having become familiar with the advanced
civilization of foreign countries did he return to his
own, filled with grand ideas, with lofty, patriotic
feelings, his brain seething, and his soul thirsting for
action, in order to conquer for himself a sphere of
public activity.</p>

<p>The Diet of 1825 afforded him a fitting opportunity
in this direction. During the thirteen years
preceding the convoking of this Diet the country had
been ruled in the most absolute manner. The government
ignored, during that period, the constitution, collected
by force of arms and arbitrarily illegal taxes,
filled, in the same despotic way, the ranks of the
army, fettered the liberty of the press, and deprived
the nation of her ancient rights. These acts of violence
stirred up the indignation of the country, and
the natural reaction was still more roused and fostered
by the dawning Hungarian literature which
proclaimed a brighter future to the nation. Csokonai,
Francis Kazinczy, Alexander and Charles Kis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a><br /><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>faludy,
Michael Vörösmarty, Francis Kölcsey, and
other eminent writers were the fathers of a new era
in Hungarian literature, and by their works they
kindled the national feeling and roused the public
spirit. The nation awoke and was eager to march in
the footsteps of the civilization of Europe. She
only lacked a leader, but in the course of the deliberations
of the Diet of 1825, that leader was found.</p>

<span class="caption">HALT OF GYPSIES.</span></a></div>

<p>Stephen Széchenyi, being a member of the Upper
House by right of birth, took his seat there among
the aristocracy of the land. His first act was destined
to be the precursor of a new epoch in the history
of the nation. On the 25th of October he made
a short speech; his manner was embarrassed and
confused; but he spoke in Hungarian, a proceeding
which was looked upon at that time as a revolutionary
act, full of boldness, and which excited the utmost
indignation of the highest circles. The Latin
language had until then remained, in keeping with
the traditions of the past, the official language of
the House of Magnates, Széchenyi was the first
magnate who dared to cut loose from the ancient
tradition, and, although a great portion of his fellow-magnates,
especially the older ones, were shocked at
the innovation, yet the number of Hungarian-speaking
great lords continually increased after this, and the
bold stand he took on that occasion had much to do
with the restoration of the national language to its
rightful place.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Lower House witnessed the triumph
achieved by him in the cause of Hungarian
culture. During the preliminary sessions preceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
the plenary ones, the question had been deliberated
upon for several days as to the best means of fostering
the national language. Széchenyi, with several
of his noble friends, was present at one of these conferences,
listening and looking on. Each deputy in
turn stated his views on the subject. One of them,
Paul Nagy, a distinguished orator of the opposition,
declared, with an air of deep conviction, that to cultivate
the Hungarian language with a view to make
it successfully compete with the Germanizing tendencies
of the government, and with the Latin
language, it was necessary to establish a Hungarian
academy of sciences. To accomplish this, he added,
money was needed, and this could not be obtained
from the government, which was hostile to the
scheme. Let the nation furnish the money, the
great lords, the owners of the vast fortunes and
landed estates, setting first a good example to the
rest. The effect of these kindling words was a thrilling
one. Széchenyi immediately stepped forward,
and, addressing the presiding officer, asked leave to
say a few words. Amidst the general attention of
those present he briefly stated that he was ready to
contribute one year’s entire income from his estates
to a fund wherewith to found an institute
whose object would be the fostering of the Hungarian
language. These simple words were received
with a storm of applause. A remarkable spectacle
now ensued. One man after another arose eager to
contribute to the fund of the future Hungarian Academy
of Sciences, and the sum was soon swelled
to 154,000 florins, Széchenyi’s contribution alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
amounting to 60,000 florins. The institute was soon
established, and, thanks to the patriotic support of
the nation, the funds of the Academy exceed at present
2,000,000 florins. The activity of this institute
has proved, for the last fifty years, most beneficial
to the development of the Hungarian language and
the advancement of science in the country.</p>

<p>This munificent act placed Széchenyi at once in the
front ranks of the nation, and the very enthusiasm
roused by his generous patriotism was the means of
exciting his best energies, and of spurring him on to
further action. Széchenyi, although acting, on the
whole, with the exceedingly moderate opposition,
which was conservative and not unfrequently quite
reactionary, influenced as it was by the famous policy
of Prince Metternich, never became a member
of either of the political parties. His leading idea
was that the first thing to be done was to improve
the material and intellectual condition of
the people, and to increase the prosperity and
culture of the country. He had founded in the
interest of civilization the Hungarian Academy, and
now he labored enthusiastically to improve the
commercial, industrial, and economical condition of
the country. In this work he had to contend with
all sorts of obstacles and prejudices on the part not
only of the higher circles, but of the very class that
was to be benefited by his reforms. But Széchenyi
did not lose heart, and, undisturbed by many a bitter
experience, he undeviatingly pursued his own course,
and carried through with an iron will every measure
deemed beneficial by him. His busy brain never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
ceased to devise new patriotic schemes, and to make
them acceptable to the people. He won back the
estranged aristocracy of the country, and assigned to
them a leading position in national politics; he
strove to raise the capital to a European level, and
advanced the national prosperity by the discovery
of new resources, the opening of new roads of communication,
and by the creation of many useful
public institutions. He had equal regard for the interests
of all classes, from the lord to the peasant,
and thus strove, while yet surrounded by the antiquated
order of things, to awaken the people to a
sense of national consciousness, and to promote the
recognition of the solidarity of interests between all
the classes of the nation. His busy brain embraced
every public interest, and he exerted every social
and economical agency to ripen in the nation the
notions of modern European civilization. He was a
powerful agitator, in equal degrees master of the
sword and the pen, and although his whole individuality,
his character, and his habits bore the stamp of
the aristocratic circle in which he was born and educated,
yet, by dint of his conspicuous and many-sided
labors, he in reality was the most indefatigable
champion and pioneer of democratic ideas in his own
country.</p>

<p>His first great literary work (a smaller one had preceded
it), entitled “Credit,” was published in 1830, and
in it he treated of economical questions of the most immediate
importance to the country. It was a work
of great power, marked by scholarly thoroughness,
practical statesmanship, and poetic elevation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
produced an extraordinary sensation throughout the
country. It was read everywhere, in the palaces of
the magnates, in the mansions of the provincial
gentry, and in the homes and offices of merchants
and tradesmen. The book was spoken of in the
most exalted terms by some, while others declared
its author to be a communist and revolutionary agitator.
The foes to progress, the defenders of the
decaying privileges of the nobility, burned the book,
while the friends of the new ideas, and especially the
rising generation, saw in it the gospel of a new era.
It was in this work that Széchenyi, addressing the
generation that vainly clung to the reminiscences of
the past, said: “Do not constantly trouble yourselves
with the vanished glories of the past, but
rather let your determined patriotism bring about
the prosperity of the beloved fatherland. Many there
are who think that <i>Hungary has been</i>, but for my
part I like to think that <i>Hungary shall be</i>.”</p>

<p>Under the influence of these exalted ideas Széchenyi
persevered in his practical efforts for the common
weal. He wrote a great deal up to the time of
his death, and some of his works are justly ranked
among the gems of Hungarian literature. But more
precious than these are his practical creations, which
still, for the most part, survive, and which are destined
to perpetuate his fame for many centuries to
come. His busy mind attended to every variety of
matters of public concern. Thus it was he who introduced
horse-racing into the country, not for the
purpose of affording a mere gentlemanly pastime,
but with the object of developing horse-breeding in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
Hungary, an object which has been very successfully
accomplished by the new sport. In furtherance
of this object he formed a society which subsequently
became the National Breeding Association,
which flourishes to this day. In order to afford
to the gentry permanently a rallying and central
point in the country, he established the Buda-Pesth
National Casino, a social club of high distinction, still
in existence and enjoying an enviable reputation in
the best European circles. He took quite an active
part in the management of the new Academy of
Sciences; zealously supported the efforts made to
found a permanent national theatre, efforts which
subsequently proved successful; started and realized
the scheme for building a permanent bridge across
the Danube, connecting Pesth and Buda, and for the
construction of a tunnel under the castled mountain
of Buda; conducted for years the work of regulating
the Danube, especially in the vicinity of the Vaskapu
(Iron Gate); and also aided in the establishment
of the Danube Steam Navigation Company,
which at this day has hundreds of ships
engaged in the local and export trade. His most
glorious work, however, was the regulation of the
Theiss, resulting, in the course of time, in the reclaiming
of a marshy territory containing one hundred
and fifty square miles, and turning it into a
rich and fertile soil. His mind was teeming, besides,
with various schemes looking to the building of railways,
and to the promotion of commerce and industry;
but all these various undertakings were marked
by the same steady spirit of patriotic endeavor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span></p>

<p>For fifteen years, up to 1840, the popularity of
Széchenyi had gone on increasing throughout the
country, and his name was cherished by every good
patriot in the land. About this time, however, the
great statesman was destined to come into collision
with a man who was his peer in genius and abilities.
The two patriots were representatives of different
methods, and in the contest produced by the shock of
antagonistic tendencies Széchenyi was compelled to
yield to Louis Kossuth, his younger rival. Although
there was no material difference between their aims,
for both wished to see their country great, free, constitutionally
governed, prosperous, and advanced in
civilization, yet in the ways and means employed by
them to attain that aim they were diametrically
opposed to each other. Széchenyi, who descended
from a family of ancient and aristocratic lineage,
and presented himself to the nation with connections
reaching up into the highest circles of the court,
with the lustre of his ancient name, and with his immense
fortune, wished to secure the happiness of his
country by quite different methods from those
adopted by Louis Kossuth, a child of the people,
who, although he was a nobleman by birth, yet belonged
to that poorer class of gentry who support
themselves by their own exertions, and who, in Hungary,
are destined to fulfil the mission of the citizen-classes
of other countries. It is from these classes of
the gentry that are, for the most part, recruited the
tradespeople, the smaller landowners, professional
men, writers, subordinate officials, lawyers, physicians,
clergymen, teachers, and professors. By virtue of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
their nobility, it is true, they belonged to the privileged
class of the country, and were not subjected
to the humiliations of the oppressed peasantry, yet
they had to earn a living by their own work, and
were therefore not only accessible to, but were ready
enthusiastically to receive, the lofty message of liberty
and equality which the French Revolution of
1830 began to proclaim anew throughout all Europe.
These doctrines formed a sharp contrast to the views
of Count Stephen Széchenyi, views which, owing to
the social position of the man who held them, were
not devoid of a certain aristocratic tinge, and according
to which the most important part in the regeneration
of the Hungarian nation was assigned to the
aristocracy. It was a part, however, which the Hungarian
aristocracy was itself by no means disposed to
assume. Among its younger members, indeed, could
be found, here and there, enthusiastic men who were
devotedly attached to the person of the lordly reformer,
but the great majority of his class were hostilely
arrayed against Széchenyi’s aims, and, obstructing
the granting of even the most inoffensive demands
of the nation, supported the Viennese government,
which was rigidly opposed to political reforms and to
any changes in the public institutions of the country.
This attitude of the aristocracy compelled Széchenyi
to avoid as much as possible all questions concerning
constitutionality and liberty, and to confine the work
of reform chiefly to the sphere of internal improvements.
The only way in which he could hope to
obtain the support of the court of Vienna and of the
majority of the Upper House for his politico-econom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>ical
measures, was to remain as neutral as possible in
politics. The idea which chiefly governed his actions
was that the country should be first strengthened internally,
and that afterwards it would be easy for the
nation to bring about the triumph of her national
and political aspirations.</p>

<p>After 1840, however, the bulk of the nation, and
especially the small gentry whose preponderating
influence was making itself continually felt, were
unwilling to follow Széchenyi in his one-sided policy.
The reformatory work of Széchenyi during the preceding
fifteen years had educated public opinion up
to new and great ideas, but the leaders of that
public opinion were now to be found in the House of
Representatives in the persons of Francis Deák and
Louis Kossuth. They wished to obtain for their
country both political liberty and material prosperity.
They knew the effect of political institutions upon
the material well-being and civilization of a nation,
and they no longer deemed it possible to attain
these objects without a modern constitutional government.
Louis Kossuth, who was born in 1802,
was the very incarnation of the great democratic
ideas of his age. He was entirely a man of work
and entered the legal profession, after having completed
his studies with great distinction, for the
purpose of supporting himself by it. Kossuth
was present at the Diet of 1832, when the government,
which conducted itself most brutally
and arbitrarily towards the press, refused to allow
the newspapers to print reports of the deliberations
of the Diet in spite of the repeated urgings by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
the deputies for such an authorization, and it was
owing to his ingenuity that this prohibition was
evaded. The censorship was exercised on printed
matter only and did not extend to manuscripts.
Kossuth wrote out the reports of the Diet himself,
had numerous copies made of them in writing, and
circulated them, for a slight fee, in every part of the
country, where they were looked for with feverish
expectation, and, owing to the spirit of opposition
with which they were colored, were read with the
greatest eagerness. This manuscript newspaper produced
quite a revolutionary movement amongst the
people, frightening even the Austrian government.
The latter now attempted to silence Kossuth by
gentle means, promising him high offices and a pension,
but he refused the enticing offers and continued
his work for the benefit of the nation. Foiled in
the attempt to lure Kossuth from his duty, the government
resorted to violence, seized the lithographic
apparatus by means of which Kossuth planned to
multiply his manuscript newspaper, and gave directions
to the postmasters to detain and open all those
sealed packages which were supposed to contain the
reports. But these arbitrary proceedings of the
government could not put an end to the circulation
of the newspaper; the country gentlemen, by their
own servants, continued to send each other single
copies, and the matter was given up only when the
Diet ceased to be in session. Then Kossuth, at the
urgent request of his friends and, one might say,
of the whole country, started a new manuscript
newspaper at Buda-Pesth, which reported the delib<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>erations
of the county assemblies. The effect produced
by this new paper was fraught with even
greater consequences than the first had created, for
it was instrumental in bringing the counties into
contact with each other, thus affording them an opportunity
to combine against the government. The
latter, however, soon prohibited its publication, but
the prohibition gave rise to a storm of indignation
throughout the whole country. The counties in
solid array addressed protests to the government
against the illegal act and on behalf of Kossuth,
who continued to publish the paper in spite of the
inhibition. The government at last resorted to the
most barefaced brutality. Kossuth, the brave champion
of liberty, its eloquent pen and herald, was
dragged to a damp and dark subterranean prison-cell
in the castle of Buda, and detained there, whilst
his father and mother and his family, who were
looking to him solely for their support, were robbed
of the aid of their natural protector.</p>

<p>Although at that period lawlessness was the order
of the day, yet this last cruel and illegal act of the
government greatly exasperated the public mind,
which was already in a ferment of excitement. But
while the excited passions raged throughout the
country, the government, nothing loth, caused Kossuth
to be prosecuted for high treason, and, having
obtained his conviction, had him sentenced to an
imprisonment of three years. Kossuth applied
himself during his detention to serious studies, and
acquired also, while in prison, the English language
to such an extent that he was enabled to ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>dress
in that language, during his exile, with great
effect and impressiveness, large audiences both in
England and in the United States of America. His
imprisonment lasted two long years, after the lapse of
which he obtained, in 1840, a pardon in consequence
of the repeated and urgent representations of the
Diet.</p>

<p>Kossuth returned to the scene of his former
activity as the martyr of free speech, and the victim
to the cause of the nation. He very soon found a
new field in which to labor. The government perceived
at last that violence was of little avail, and
that those questions which were occupying the
minds to such a degree could no longer be kept
from being publicly discussed by the press. Kossuth
now obtained permission to edit a political daily
paper. Its publication was commenced under the
title of <i>Pesti Hirlap</i> (Pesth Newspaper) in 1841, and
may be said to have created the political daily press
of Hungary. It disseminated new ideas among the
masses, stirred up the indifferent to feel an interest
in the affairs of the country and gave a purpose to
the national aspirations. It proclaimed democratic
reforms in every department; the abolition of the
privileges of the nobility and of their exemption
from taxation, equal rights and equal burdens for
all the citizens of the state, and the extension of
public instruction, and it endeavored to restore the
Hungarian nationality to the place it was entitled to
claim in the organism of the state.</p>

<p>The wealth of ideas thus daily communicated to
the country appeared in the most attractive garb, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
Kossuth possessed a masterly style, and his leaders
and shorter articles showed off to advantage
so many unexpected beauties of the Hungarian language,
that his readers were fairly enchanted and
carried away by them. His articles were a happy
compound of poetical elevation and oratorical power,
gratifying common-sense and the imagination at the
same time, appealing by their lucid exposition to the
reader’s intelligence, and exciting and warming this
fancy by their fervor. Kossuth always rightly
guessed what questions most interested the nation,
and the daily press became, in his hands, a power
in Hungary, electrifying the masses, who were always
ready to give their unconditional support to his bold
and far-reaching schemes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="i440" id="i440">
<img src="images/i_440.png" width="500" height="343" alt="GYPSIES AND LADY." />
<span class="caption">GYPSIES AND LADY.</span></a></div>

<p>The extraordinary influence obtained by Kossuth
through his paper frightened Széchenyi, and, to even
a greater degree, those whose prejudices were shocked
or ancient privileges and interests were endangered
by the democratic agitations for reform. Kossuth
was attacked in books, pamphlets, and newspapers,
but he came out victorious from all contests. In
vain did Széchenyi himself, backed by his great
authority in the land, assail him, declaring that he
did not object to Kossuth’s ideas, but that his manner
and his tactics were reprehensible, and that the
latter were sure to lead to a revolution. The great
mass of the people felt instinctively that revolution
had become a necessity and was unavoidable, if Hungary
was to pass from the old mediæval order to the
establishment of modern institutions, and was to become
a state where equality before the law should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a><br /><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>be the ruling standard. The masses were strengthened
in this conviction by the unreasonable, short-sighted,
and violent policy pursued by the government
of Vienna, which obstructed the slightest
reforms in the ancient institutions and opposed every
national aspiration, and under whose protecting wing
the reactionary elements of the Upper House were
constantly paralyzing the noblest and best efforts made
by the Lower House for the public weal, while the
same government arbitrarily supported claims of the
Catholic clergy, in flat contradiction to the rights
and liberties of the various denominations inhabiting
the country. The government, in its antipathy to
the national movement, went even further. It secretly
incited the other nationalities, especially the
Croats, against the Hungarians, and thus planted the
seeds from which sprang the subsequent great civil
war. In observing the dangerous symptoms preceding
the last-mentioned movement, and the bloody
scenes and fights provoked at every election by the
hirelings of the government, in order to intimidate
the adherents of reform, the friends of progress became
more and more convinced that the period of
moderation, such as preached by Széchenyi, had passed
by, and must give way to that resolute policy, advocated
by Kossuth, which recoiled from no consequences.
Numerous magnates, all the chief leaders
of the gentry, boasting of enlightenment and patriotism,
and imbued with European culture, rallied
around Kossuth, until finally the public opinion of
the country and the enthusiasm of which he was the
centre caused him to be returned, in 1847, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
with Count Louis Batthyányi, as deputy from the
foremost county of the country, the county of Pesth.</p>

<p>During the first months the Diet of 1847—’8, which
was to raise Hungary to the rank of those countries
that proclaimed equal rights and possessed a responsible
parliamentary government, differed very little
from the one preceding it. The opposition initiated,
as before, great reforms, but there was no one who
believed that their realization was near at hand.
Kossuth repeatedly addressed the House, and soon
convinced his audience that he was as irresistible an
orator as he had proved powerful as a writer. But
there was nothing to indicate that the country was
on the eve of a great transformation.</p>

<p>The revolution of February, 1848, which broke out
in Paris, changed, as if by magic, the relative positions
of Austria and Hungary. Metternich’s system
of government, which was opposed to granting liberty
to the people, collapsed at once. The storm of popular
indignation swept it away like a house built of
cards. At the first news of the occurrences in Paris
Kossuth asked in the Lower House for the creation
of a responsible ministry. Kossuth’s motion was
favorably received by the Lower House, but in the
Upper House it was rejected, the government not
being yet alive to the real state of affairs, and still
hoping by a system of negation to frustrate the
wishes of the people. But very soon the revolution
reared its head in Vienna itself, and the wishes of
the Hungarian people, uttered at Buda-Pesth, received
thereby a new and powerful advocate.</p>

<p>At that time the Hungarian Diet still met at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
Presburg, but the two sister cities of Buda and
Pesth formed the real capital of the country, and
were the centre of commerce, industry, science,
and literature. Michael Vörösmarty, the poet laureate
of the nation, lived in Pesth, and there the twin
stars of literature, Alexander Petöfi and Maurus
Jókai, shone on the national horizon. Jókai, who is
still living and enjoys a world-wide fame as a novelist,
and Petöfi, the eminent poet, who was destined to
become the Tyrtæus of his nation, were then both
young men, full of enthusiasm and intrepid energy,
and teeming with great ideas. About these two
gathered the other writers and youth of the university,
and all of them, helping each other, contrived,
upon hearing the news of the sudden revolutions in
Paris and Vienna, to enact in Buda-Pesth the bloodless
revolution of the 15th of March, 1848, which
obtained the liberty of the press for the nation, and
at the same time, in a solemn manifesto, gave expression
to the wishes of the Hungarians in the matter
of reform. The only act of violence these revolutionary
heroes were guilty of was the entering of a
printing establishment, whose proprietor, afraid of
the government, had refused to print the admirable
poem of Petöfi, entitled <i>Talpra Magyar</i> (Up Magyar),
and doing the printing there themselves. The
first verse of this poem, which subsequently became
the war song of the national movement, runs in a
literal translation thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Arise, oh Magyar! thy country calls.</div>
<div class="line">Here is the time, now or never.</div>
<div class="line">Shall we be slaves or free?</div>
<div class="line"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
That is the question—choose!</div>
<div class="line">We swear by the God of the Magyars,</div>
<div class="line">We swear, to be slaves no longer!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This soul-stirring poem was improvised by Petöfi
under the inspiration of the moment, and at the same
establishment where it was first printed was also
printed a proclamation which contained twelve articles
setting forth the wishes of the people.</p>

<p>While the capital was resounding with the rejoicings
and triumphant shouts of her exulting inhabitants,
the proper department of the government for the
carrying through of these movements, the Diet, assembled
at Presburg, lost no time, and set to work
with great energy to reform the institutions of Hungary,
constitutionally, and to put into the form of
law the ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity.
The salutary legislation met now with no opposition,
either from the Upper House or from the court at
Vienna, and in a short time the Diet passed the celebrated
acts of 1848, which, having received the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
sanction, were proclaimed as laws on the 11th of
April, at Presburg, amidst the wildest enthusiasm, in
the presence of King Ferdinand V.</p>

<p>By these laws Hungary became a modern state,
possessing a constitutional government. The government
was vested in a ministry responsible to
parliament, all the inhabitants of the country were
declared equal before the law, the privileges of the
nobility were abolished, the soil was declared free,
and the right of free worship accorded to all. The
institution of national guards was introduced, the
utmost liberty of the press was secured, Transylvania
became a part of the mother country—in a
word, the national and political condition of the
country was reorganized, in every particular, in harmony
with the spirit, the demands, and aspirations
of our age. At the same time the men placed at
the head of the government were such as possessed
the fullest confidence of the people. The first ministry
was composed of the most distinguished patriots.
Count Louis Batthyányi was the president, and acting
in conjunction with him were Francis Deák, as minister
of justice, Count Stephen Széchenyi, as minister
of home affairs, and Louis Kossuth, as minister of
finance.</p>

<span class="caption">HUNGARIAN GYPSY.</span></a></div>

<p>The great mass of the people hailed with boundless
enthusiasm the new government and the magnificent
reforms. The transformation, however, had
been so sudden and unexpected, and the old aristocratic
world, with all its institutions and its ancient organization,
had been swept away with such vehement,
precipitation, that even under ordinary circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
in the absence of all opposition, the new ideas and
tendencies could have hardly entered into the political
life of the nation without causing no little confusion
and disorder. But, in addition to these natural drawbacks,
the new order of things had to contend with
certain national elements in the population, which,
feeling themselves injured in their real or imaginary
interests, were bent on mischief, hoping to be able
to rob the nation, in the midst of the ensuing troubles,
of the great political prize she had won. Certain
circles of the court and classes of the people strove
equally hard to surround with difficulties the practical
introduction of the constitution of 1848. The
court and the standing army, the party of the sol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>dier
class, feared that their commanding position
would be impaired by the predominating influence
of the people. The non-Hungarian portion of the
inhabitants, choosing to ignore the fact that the new
laws secured, without distinction of nationality, equal
rights to every citizen of the state, were apprehensive
lest the liberal constitution would chiefly benefit
the Hungarian element of the nation. They, therefore,
encouraged by the secret machinations of the
government of Vienna, took up arms, in order to
drag the country, which was preparing to take possession
of her new liberties, into a civil war. The
Croatians, under the lead of Ban Jellachich, and the
Wallachs and Serbs, led by other imperial officers,
and yielding to their persuasions, rose in rebellion
against Hungary, and began to persecute, plunder,
and murder the Hungarians living among them.
Dreadful atrocities were committed in the southern
and eastern portions of Hungary, hundreds
and hundreds of families were massacred in cold
blood, and entire villages and cities were deserted
by their inhabitants, just as had previously happened
at the approach of the Turks, and thousands were
compelled to abandon their all to the rebels, in order
to escape with their bare lives. In the course of a
few weeks, the flames of rebellion had spread over a
large part of the country, and the Hungarian element,
instead of enjoying the liberties won for the
whole nation after a bitter struggle of many decades,
was under the sad necessity of resorting to armed
force in order to re-establish the internal peace.
The Hungarians now had to prove on the battle-field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
and in bloody engagements that they were worthy
of liberty and capable of defending it.</p>

<p>The government, which, by virtue of the new laws,
had meanwhile transferred its seat to Buda-Pesth,
displayed extraordinary energy in the face of the sad
difficulties besetting it. As it was impossible to rely
upon the Austrian soldiers who were still in the
country, it exerted itself to create and to organize
a national army. A portion of the national guard entered
the national army under the name of <i>honvéds</i> (defenders
of the country), a name which became before
long famous throughout the civilized world for the
glorious military achievements coupled with it. The
Hungarian soldiers, garrisoning the Austrian principalities,
hastened home, braving the greatest dangers,
partly accompanied by their officers and partly
without them. The famous Hungarian hussars, especially,
returned in great number to offer their services
to their imperilled country. But all this proved
insufficient, and as soon as the National Assembly,
elected under the new constitution, met, Kossuth,
who had been the life and soul of the government
during this trying and critical period, called upon the
nation to raise large armies for the defence of the
country. The session of the 11th of July, during
which Kossuth introduced in the House of Representatives
his motions relating to the subject, presented
a scene which beggars all description. Kossuth ascended
the tribune pale and haggard with illness, but
the never-ceasing applause which greeted him after
the first few sentences soon gave him back his strength
and his marvellous oratorical power. When he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
concluded his speech and submitted to the House
his request for 200,000 soldiers and the necessary
money, a momentary pause of deep silence ensued.
Suddenly Paul Nyáry, the leader of the opposition,
arose, and lifting his right arm towards heaven, exclaimed:
“We grant it!” The House was in a fever
of patriotic excitement; all the deputies rose from
their seats, shouting: “We grant it; we grant it!”
Kossuth, with tears in his eyes, bowed to the representatives
of the people and said: “You have risen
like one man, and I bow down before the greatness
of the nation.”</p>

<p>These sacrifices on the part of the country had become
a matter of urgent necessity. The Serb and
Wallach insurrection assumed every day larger proportions,
while the Croats, under the leadership of
Jellachich, entered Hungarian territory with the fixed
determination of depriving the nation of her constitutional
liberties. But the Hungarian government was
already able to send an army against the Croatians,
who were marching on Buda-Pesth, plundering and
laying waste every thing before them. They were
surrounded by the Hungarian forces, and a portion
of their army, nine thousand men strong, were
compelled to lay down their arms, while Jellachich,
with his remaining forces, precipitately fled from the
country. The young Hungarian army had thus
proved itself equal to the task of repulsing the
attack of the Croats, but the recent events were
nevertheless fraught with the gravest consequences.
The news of the Croatian invasion filled the Hungarians
with deep anxiety, and the extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
excitement caused by it cast a permanent cloud
over the soul of that noble and great man, Count
Széchenyi. The mind of the great patriot who had
initiated the national movement gave way under
the strain of the frightful rumors coming from the
Croatian frontier. He had been ailing for some time
back, and his nervousness constantly increased under
the pressure of the great events following each
other in rapid succession, so that when the news
came that the enemy had invaded the country
he thought that Hungary was lost. His despair
darkened his mind and he sought death in the
waves of the Danube. His family removed him to
a private asylum near Vienna, where he recovered
his mental faculties, and even wrote several books.
But he was never entirely cured of his hallucination,
and, exasperated by the vexations he was subjected
to by the Viennese government, even in the
asylum, the great patriot put an end to his own life
on the 8th of April, 1860, by a shot from a pistol.
Jellachich’s incursion had other important political
consequences. The attack on Hungary had been
made by Jellachich in the name of the Viennese
government, and the intimate connection between
the domestic disorders and the court of Vienna
became more and more apparent. This state of
things rendered inevitable a struggle between Hungary
and the unconstitutional action of the court.
The Austrian forces were arming against Hungary
on every side. Vienna, too, rose in rebellion against
the court, and now the Hungarians hastened to assist
the revolutionists in the Austrian capital. Unfortu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>nately
the young national army was not ripe yet for
so great a military enterprise, and Prince Windischgrätz,
having crushed the revolution in Vienna, invaded
Hungary.</p>

<p>A last attempt was now made by the Hungarians
to negotiate peace with the court, but it failed,
Windischgrätz being so elated with his success that
nothing short of unconditional submission on the
part of the country would satisfy him. To accept
such terms would have been both cowardly and
suicidal, and the nation, therefore, driven to the sad
alternative of war, determined rather to perish gloriously
than to pusillanimously submit to be enslaved
by the court. They followed the lead of Kossuth,
who was now at the head of the government, whilst
Görgei was the commander-in-chief of the Hungarian
army. The two names of Kossuth and Görgei soon
constituted the glory of the nation. Whilst these
two acted in harmony they achieved brilliant triumphs,
but their personal antagonism greatly contributed,
at a subsequent period, to the calamities of
the country.</p>

<p>Windischgrätz took possession of Buda in January,
1849, thus compelling Kossuth to transfer the seat
of government to Debreczen, whilst Görgei withdrew
with his army to the northern part of Hungary,
but the national army fought victoriously against
the Serbs and Wallachs, and the situation of the
Hungarians had, in the course of the winter, become
more favorable all over the country. The genius of
Kossuth brought again and again, as if by magic,
fresh armies into the field, and he was indefatigable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
in organizing the defence of the country. Distinguished
generals like Görgei, Klapka, Damjanics,
Bem, and others transformed the raw recruits, in a
wonderfully short time, into properly disciplined
troops, who were able to hold their own and bravely
contend against the old and tried imperial forces
whom they put to flight at every point.</p>

<p>The fortunes of war changed in favor of the Hungarians
in the latter part of January, 1849. Klapka
achieved the first triumph, which was followed by
the brilliant victory won by one of Görgei’s divisions
commanded by Guyon in the battle of Branyiszkó,
and very soon the Hungarian armies acted on the
offensive at all points. In the course of a few weeks
they achieved, chiefly under Görgei’s leadership,
great and complete victories over the enemy near
Szolnok, Hatvan, Bicske, Vácz, Isaszegh, Nagy
Sarló, and Komárom. Windischgrätz lost both the
campaign and his position as commander-in-chief.
Towards the close of the spring of 1849, after besieged
Komárom had been relieved by the Hungarians,
and Bem had driven from Transylvania not
only the Austrians, but the Russians who had come
to their assistance, the country was almost freed
from her enemies, and only two cities, Buda and
Temesvár, remained in the hands of the Austrians.
The glorious efforts made by the nation were attended
at last by splendid successes, and the civilized
world spoke with sympathy and respect of the Hungarian
people which had signally shown its ability
to defend its liberties, constitution, and national existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span></p>

<p>It should have been the mission of diplomacy, at
this conjuncture, to turn to advantage the recent
military successes by negotiating an honorable peace
with the humbled dynasty, as had been done
before in the history of the country, after similar
military achievements by the ancient national leaders,
Bocskáy and Bethlen. Görgei, the head of the
army was disposed to conclude peace. But the
Hungarian Parliament sitting in Debreczen, led by
Kossuth and under the influence of the recent victories,
were determined to pursue a different course.
The royal house of Hapsburg, whose dynasty had
ruled over Hungary for three centuries, was declared
to have forfeited its right to the throne by instigating
and bringing upon the country the calamities of
a great war. This act had a bad effect, especially on
the army, tending also to heighten the personal
antagonism between Kossuth and Görgei. But its
worst consequence was that it gave Russia a pretext
for armed intervention. The emperor Francis Joseph
entered into an alliance with the Czar of Russia, the
purpose of which was to reconquer seceded Hungary
and ultimately to crush her liberty.</p>

<p>One more brilliant victory was achieved by the
Hungarian arms before the fatal blow was aimed at
the country. The fortress of Buda was taken after
a gallant assault, in the course of which the Austrian
commandant bombarded the defenceless city of
Pesth on the opposite bank of the Danube, and thus
the capital, too, was restored to the country. Yet
after this last glorious feat of war, good fortune deserted
the national banners. The grand heroic epoch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
was hastening to its tragic end. Two hundred thousand
Russians crossed the borders of Hungary, and
were there reinforced by sixty thousand to seventy
thousand Austrians, whom the Viennese government
had succeeded in collecting for a last great effort.
It was easy to foresee that the exhausted Hungarian
army could not long resist the superior numbers opposed
to them. For months they continued the
gallant fight, and it was in one of these engagements
that Petöfi, the great poet of the nation, lost his
life, but in the month of August, the Russians had
already succeeded in surrounding Görgei’s army.
Görgei, who was now invested with the supreme
power, perceiving that all further effusion of blood
was useless, surrendered, in the sight of the Russian
army, the sword he had so gloriously worn in many
a battle, near Világos, on the 13th of August, 1849.
The remaining Hungarian armies followed his example,
and either capitulated or disbanded. The
brave army of the <i>honvéds</i> was no more, and the gallant
struggle for liberty was put an end to by the
superior numbers of the Russian forces. Kossuth
and many other Hungarians sought refuge in Turkey.</p>

<p>Above Komárom, the largest fortress in the county,
alone the Hungarian colors were still floating. General
Klapka, its commandant, bravely defended it,
and continued to hold it for six weeks after the sad
catastrophe of Világos. The brave defenders, seeing
at last that further resistance served no purpose, as
the Hungarian army had ceased to exist, and the
whole country had passed into the hands of the Austrians,
capitulated upon most honorable terms. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
was the concluding act of the heroic struggle of the
Hungarian people, the brave attitude of the garrison
and their commander adding another bright page to
the already honorable record of the military achievements
of 1848 and 1849.</p>

<p>As soon as the imperialists had obtained possession
of Komárom, their commander-in-chief, Baron Haynau,
began to persecute the patriots, and to commit
the most cruel atrocities against them. Those who
had taken part in the national war were brought before
a court-martial and summarily executed. The
bloody work of the executioner commenced on the
6th of October. Count Louis Batthyányi was shot
at Pesth, and thirteen gallant generals, belonging
to Görgei’s army, met their deaths at Arád. Wholesale
massacres were committed throughout the
country, until at last the conscience of Europe rose
up against these cruel butcheries, and the court itself
removed the sanguinary baron from the scene of his
inhuman exploits. The best men in the country
were thrown into prison, and thousands of families
had to mourn for dear ones who had fallen victims
to the implacable vindictiveness of the Austrian government.
Once more the gloom of oppression settled
upon the unhappy country.</p>

<span class="caption">HUNGARIAN LADY.</span></a></div>

<p>Many of the patriots had accompanied Kossuth
to Turkey, or found a refuge in other foreign countries,
and for ten years a great number of distinguished
Hungarians were compelled to taste the
bitterness of exile. Kossuth himself went subsequently
to England, and visited also the United
States. In the latter country he was enthusiastically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
received by the free and great American nation, who
took delight in his lofty eloquence. During the Crimean
war, and the war of 1859 in Italy, Kossuth and
the Hungarian exiles were zealously laboring to free
their country by foreign aid from the thraldom of oppression.
At last, however, the Hungarian nation succeeded
in reconquering, without any aid from abroad,
by her own exertions, her national and political
rights, and made her peace with the ruling dynasty.
But the Hungarian exiles had their full share in the
work of reconciliation, for it was owing to their exertions
that the nations of Europe remembered that,
in spite of Világos, Hungary still existed, and that
again, at home, the people of Hungary were not per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>mitted
to lose their faith in a better and brighter
future. Kossuth, the Nestor of the struggle for
liberty, lives at present in retirement in Turin, and,
although separated from his people by diverging
political theories, his countrymen will forever cherish
in him the great genius who gave liberty to millions
of the oppressed peasantry, and who indelibly inscribed
on the pages of the national legislation the
immortal principles of liberty and equality of rights.</p>

<p>It is proper, however, to present in their regular
order the chief events through which down-trodden
Hungary of 1849 became from a subordinate province
again an independent kingdom, taking part as an
equal partner in the great realm of Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>It was not until 1854 that the state of siege inaugurated
in 1849 was abolished, and only in 1856 that
an amnesty was proclaimed. In 1857 the emperor
visited Hungary, and during his stay, he decreed the
restoration of their confiscated estates to the late
political offenders. From this time the emperor
and the government of Vienna seemed anxious, by
means of concessions to the national aims, to cause
the Hungarians to forget the bitterness and strife of
1848 and 1849. In 1858 agricultural colonists were
given special inducements to settle in specified districts,
and were allowed certain exemptions from
taxation.</p>

<p>In 1859 a most important concession was made by
the imperial government to the spirit of nationality.
By a ministerial order the language used in the
higher schools was for the future to be regulated according
to the circumstances of nationality, the pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>dominance
of German being thereby abolished. In
the same year was issued what was known as the
Protestant patent, which granted to the communes
the free administration of their own educational and
religious matters.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a name="i458" id="i458">
<img src="images/i_458.png" width="300" height="239" alt="WOMAN’S HEAD-DRESS." />
<span class="caption">WOMAN’S HEAD-DRESS.</span></a></div>

<p>In 1860 the supreme court of judicature, known as
the <i>curia regia</i>, and the county assemblies were reinstated,
and the Magyar was recognized as the official
language. Later in the year the district called
the Banate of Temesvár was re-annexed to Hungary.
In 1861 the old constitution was restored to Hungary,
including Transylvania, Croatia, and Slavonia,
and the Hungarian Diet reassembled in the old capital,
Buda, afterwards removing across the river to Pesth.
Within a few months, however, an address was presented
at Vienna demanding the fullest autonomy
for Hungary. To this the emperor declared himself
unable to accede, and the Diet was dissolved. Stringent
measures were again put into force by the impe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>rial
government, and military aid was invoked to enforce
the collection of the taxes.</p>

<p>In 1865 the Diet was opened by the emperor in
person, and the imperial assent was given to the
principle of self-government for Hungary. The provisions
of the Pragmatic Sanction (of 1722) were proposed
as the basis for the settlement of the questions
still at issue. The Diet also demanded, however, an
acknowledgment of the continuity of the constitutional
rights of 1848. Before an imperial decision
had been reached on this point, the war of 1866
broke out between Austria and Prussia (allied with
Italy), and the Diet was prorogued. The Hungarian
troops formed an important contingent in the Austrian
army which faced the Prussians in Bohemia, and
the general in command, Marshal Benedek, was himself
by birth a Hungarian. Hungarians also fought
in the army of the south, which, under the leadership
of the Archduke Albrecht, made a brief but
brilliant campaign against the Italians. In Bohemia
the Austrians met with a decisive defeat at Sadowa
(in July, 1866), and although in Italy Archduke Albrecht
gained the important battle of Custozza, and
Admiral Tegetthoff a naval victory near Lissa (in the
Adriatic), the general results of the summer’s campaign
were adverse to Austria, and brought about
material changes in its relations to Germany and
in its own imperial organization.</p>

<p>By the peace of Prague (August, 1866) the German
confederation was dissolved, and Austria’s long
preëminence among the states of Germany came to
an end, the leadership in German affairs being trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>ferred
to Prussia. The centre of gravity of the Austrian
empire (which was thus, as it were, pushed out
of Germany) was thrown southward and eastward,
and the most important result for Hungary was the
constituting of the present dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary,
finally sanctioned in February, 1867.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="i460" id="i460">
<img src="images/i_460.png" width="500" height="293" alt="CARTS." />
<span class="caption">CARTS.</span></a></div>

<p>Under this arrangement the constitutional, legal,
and administrative autonomy of 1848 was secured to
Hungary, while the full control of the army rested
with the emperor-king. The representative committee
of the Diet, which conducted and completed the
new constitutional arrangements, was headed by Deák,
and the presidency of the first ministry was given to
Count Andrássy.</p>

<p>In June, 1868, the emperor and empress were
crowned at Buda-Pesth King and Queen of Hungary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
and a complete pardon was proclaimed for all political
offenders. It is worthy of note that twice in the
checkered history of Hungary has Prussia been instrumental
in securing for the kingdom from its Austrian
rulers recognition and privileges which, had it
not been for the pressure of the Prussian attacks,
might long have been delayed.</p>

<p>In 1765, Maria Theresa, in grateful acknowledgment
of the cordially loyal support given her by her
“faithful Hungarians” in the bitter struggle against
Frederic the Great, initiated various most important
reforms, while just a century later, under the convincing
influence of the second great struggle with Prussia,
the Austrian ruler again falls back on his Hungarian
subjects as the chief support of his reorganized realm,
and in the new dual empire of Austria-Hungary the
ancient kingdom of the Magyars, whose wonderfully
elastic national vitality had withstood so many vicissitudes
and disasters, again takes a commanding place
among the nations of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messrs.</span> G. P. PUTNAM’S SONS take pleasure in
announcing that they have in course of publication a
series of graphic historical studies, intended to present to
the young the stories of the different nations that have
attained prominence in history.</p>

<p>In the story form the current of each national life
will be distinctly indicated, and its picturesque and noteworthy
periods and episodes will be presented for the
young reader in their philosophical relation to each
other as well as to universal history.</p>

<p>It will be the plan of the writers of the different
volumes to enter into the real life of the peoples, and to
bring them before the reader as they actually lived,
labored, and struggled—as they studied and wrote, and
as they amused themselves. In carrying out this plan,
the myths, with which the history of all lands begins, will
not be overlooked, though these will be carefully distinguished
from the actual history, so far as the labors of
the accepted historical authorities have resulted in definite
conclusions.</p>

<p>It is proposed to have the series present the results
of the latest investigations in the progressive department
of historical research. Disputed points will, however,
not be discussed, but, instead, the writers will present, in
a simple, direct, and graphic style, the story of each land,
utilizing also, to illuminate the narrative, the side lights
that the poets and novelists have cast upon it.</p>

<p>Possessing a knowledge of and sympathy with the
youthful way of looking at such subjects, the writers will
not offer annals, arid and unconnected, nor bare chronological
statements of events, however complete. They
will not expect to include all details of minor importance,
but, on the contrary, will try to present pictures adapted
to leave faithful impressions of the essential facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span></p>

<p>The editors will endeavor to preserve a unity of
design and execution that will enable the series to give
to the reader a survey of the rise and progress of the
nations sufficient to form a sound basis for subsequent
reading and study; but it will not be attempted to cover
in detail the entire ground of universal history.</p>

<p>The subjects of the different volumes will be planned
to cover connecting and, as far as possible, consecutive
epochs or periods, so that the set when completed will
present in a comprehensive narrative the chief events in
the great <span class="smcap">Story of the Nations</span>; but it will, of course,
not always prove practicable to issue the several volumes
in their chronological order.</p>

<p>The “Stories” are printed in good readable type, and
in handsome 12mo form. They are adequately illustrated
and furnished with maps and indexes. They are
sold separately, at a price of $1.50 each.</p>
